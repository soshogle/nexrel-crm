    "&nbsp;Darksword Armory has been creating finely made medieval weapons for the last 29 years.&nbsp; The owner, Eyal Azerad, has travelled throughout the world to document and examine various sword and armor collections, in both world class museums and by invitations to private collections. The painstaking research and experience in handling various medieval weapons, allows us to accurately create their historical counterparts, while remaining faithful to the weight, balance and feel.",
    "Medieval armor also forms part of our collection. Functional and specially made for HEMA, WMA and SCA combat, the armor is forged with 14 and 16 g steel and fully articulated for functional, comfort and usability in combat."
