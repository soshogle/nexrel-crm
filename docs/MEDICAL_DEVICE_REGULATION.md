> - restoring, correcting or modifying a body function or the body structure of human beings or animals;
> - the diagnosis of pregnancy in human beings or animals; or
> - the care of human beings or animals during pregnancy and at and after birth of the offspring"

### FDA Definition (USA):

## Is Your CRM a Medical Device?

### Analysis:

**Your CRM includes:**
- ✅ Practice management (scheduling, billing, patient records)
- ✅ DICOM image storage and viewing
- ✅ AI analysis of X-rays
- ✅ Treatment planning tools

### Classification Factors:

#### Factors That Suggest NOT a Medical Device:

1. **Practice Management Functions**
   - Scheduling, billing, patient records
   - Administrative functions
   - **NOT diagnostic or therapeutic**

2. **Image Storage/Viewing**
   - Storing and displaying images
   - **NOT making diagnostic decisions**
   - **NOT providing diagnosis**

3. **AI Analysis (Advisory)**
   - If AI is "for information only"
   - If labeled as "not for diagnostic use"
   - If requires professional interpretation

#### Factors That MIGHT Make It a Medical Device:

1. **If You Claim Diagnostic Capabilities**
   - "AI diagnoses dental conditions"
   - "Automated diagnosis"
   - "Replaces professional judgment"

2. **If You Provide Treatment Recommendations**
   - "AI recommends treatment"
   - "Automated treatment planning"

3. **If You Market as Diagnostic Tool**
   - "For diagnosis of..."
   - "Diagnostic software"

## Regulatory Classification

### Health Canada Classes:

- **Class I:** Low risk (e.g., bandages)
- **Class II:** Low-medium risk (e.g., X-ray viewers)
- **Class III:** Medium-high risk (e.g., diagnostic software)
- **Class IV:** High risk (e.g., life-supporting devices)

### Your Likely Classification:

**If considered a medical device:**
- **Class II** (if image viewing only)
- **Class III** (if AI provides diagnostic assistance)

**Most likely:** **NOT a medical device** if:
- You don't claim diagnostic capabilities
- AI is "for information only"
- Professional interpretation required

## Real-World Examples

### Similar Software:

**Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Dentitek:**
- Practice management software
- DICOM image viewing
- **NOT registered as medical devices**
- Treated as software tools

**Why?** They:
- Don't make diagnostic claims
- Require professional interpretation
- Are administrative/management tools

---

## What You Should Do

### Step 1: Determine Classification

**Ask yourself:**
1. Do you claim the software diagnoses conditions?
2. Do you claim it replaces professional judgment?
3. Do you market it as a diagnostic tool?
4. Does it make treatment decisions?

**If NO to all:** Likely NOT a medical device ✅

**If YES to any:** May need registration ⚠️

### Step 2: Get Legal Opinion (Recommended)

**Consult:**
- Health Canada regulatory consultant
- Medical device lawyer
- Regulatory affairs specialist

**Cost:** $2,000-5,000 for initial consultation

**Why:** Regulations are complex, penalties are severe

### Step 3: If NOT a Medical Device

**You still need:**
- ✅ Business license (normal business)
- ✅ Privacy compliance (Law 25) ✅ You have this
- ✅ Professional liability insurance (recommended)
- ✅ Terms of service (disclaimers)

### Step 4: If IS a Medical Device

**You need:**
- ⚠️ Health Canada Medical Device License
- ⚠️ Quality Management System (ISO 13485)
- ⚠️ Clinical evidence
- ⚠️ Labeling compliance
- ⚠️ Post-market surveillance

**Cost:** $50,000-200,000+ and 1-2 years
