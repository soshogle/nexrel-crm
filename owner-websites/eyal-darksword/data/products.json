    "content": "The axe is one of the first tools to be manufactured by humankind. The simplicity of its construction and its inherent versatility means that axes have been an integral part of every human culture.\n\nAxes however are associated to the Vikings more than any other group of warriors. Axes were a vital part of Viking life, as evidenced by archaeological digs at Viking sites. However, it's important to understand that the basis of Viking life was not raping and pillaging, but agriculture. Axes were an essential farming and household tool. As they did with all of their weapons, Vikings usually named their axes, often naming them after she-trolls. However, axes never had the same cultural significance to Viking warriors as swords and spears did. The Viking axe was not a sacred weapon but an immensely practical one; something that could be for combat but was most commonly called on for simple domestic or agricultural duties.\n\nIn war however, the Viking axe was a devastating weapons in hand-to-hand combat, capable of splitting a man's skull, or thrown against an opponent\u2019s shield.\n\nAround the 10th century, the Vikings developed the weapon known as the Dane Axe. This is that huge, terrifying battle axe that we commonly associate with Vikings. Its shaft could be as long as six feet, and the head had a cutting surface of up to twelve inches. The head of the Dane Axe was extremely thin, with thicknesses as narrow as 2mm along the edge of the blade. With a lightweight design, these were easy to swing and provided a wide radius of destruction with little risk to the axe getting stuck, although they were not as useful in hand-to-hand combat as the smaller hand axe.\n\nAlthough associated with Vikings - the Dane Axe still appears on the state coat of arms of Norway - the Dane Axe was actually most popular in England, where it continued to be used into the 16th century, long after the influence of the Vikings had waned.\n\nTotal length: 41.5 \"\nBlade Height: 13.5\"\nBlade Length: 9.5\"\nWeight: 3.9 lbs",

They were made in Gondolin for the Goblin-wars. They must have come from a dragon's hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. ... This, Gandalf, was Glamdring, Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore. Keep them well!\"</p>\n<em>--The Hobbit, Chapter 3</em>\n\nElves are mythical and magical creatures in many forms of fantasy literature, and nowhere do they receive more attention than in J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s writings. The firstborn Children of the creator Iluvatar, the Elves\u2019 long history winds through countless triumphs and tragedies written as only Tolkien could write. They awoke under the stars of Middle Earth in a time before the sun and the moon existed, and were beloved of the Valar \u2013 the gods of Middle Earth. Because of their great love for the Elves the Valar gathered a large number of them and brought them to the undying land of Valinor across the sea, keeping them safe from harm.\n\nAlas, the Valar could not keep the Elves safe from their own foolish pride. While in Valinor the mighty craftsman F\u00ebanor forged the holy Silmarils, gems of surpassing beauty, using the light that the Valar had brough into the world. Even though he had not created this light F\u00ebanor was haughty about his work and denied them to any but his own hand. This created a deep divide between F\u00ebanor\u2019s allies and those loyal to the Valar, and into that divide crept Melkor the dark Valar.\n\nMelkor stole the Silmarils and slew F\u00ebanor\u2019s beloved father, then fled to his fortress back in Middle Earth. What followed was centuries of bloody battles as first F\u00ebanor and then his sons and their houses pursued Melkor and sought to strip him of the Silmarils that they believed were theirs by right. As the battles dragged on the sons of F\u00ebanor and their allies began to set up kingdoms of their own to rule, and of these kingdoms none were so beautiful, so powerful, and so glorious and Gondolin.\n\nRuled by Turgon, nephew of F\u00ebanor and High King of the Elves known as the Nolder, Gondolin was a city hidden deep in the mountains and accessible only by concealed paths. The city was\n\nbuilt in secret as the last bastion of safety for the Noldor, to be their seat of power from which to wage war upon the forces of darkness. The stories about Gondolin and its eventual discovery and destruction by the forces of Melkor are far too many to be included here (see The Silmarillion for more details), but what can be told is that from the forges of Gondolin came many mighty weapons of great power \u2013 and of these weapons, perhaps none are as famous as Glamdring the Foe Hammer.\n\nA long sword of great beauty, Glamdrin belonged to the ruler of Gondolin. Turgon wielded Glambring in many battles including the Battle of Unnumbered Tears where the Elves and their allies were routed thanks to the treachery of men. Turgon likely used the sword as well during the fall of Gondolin, after which it became lost for thousands of years and might have passed out of Tolkien\u2019s lore altogether. However, Glamdring actually makes its first appearance for most readers in the pages of The Hobbit, when Gandalf the Grey finds it in a troll-cave along with other Elven blades and treasures. Gandalf carries the sword for the rest of his adventures, and it likely accompanied him when he left Middle Earth and returned to his masters in Valinor.\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\nA deep respect for Tolkien and his works was maintained during the creation of this battle ready sword. The smooth and subtle curves of the blade, guard and pommel were meant as a reflection of wisdom and understanding while the downward looping guard flows towards the curves of the blade in a form of dance between both parts. Despite this seemingly fragile aestheticism, this medieval fantasy sword is nothing but stern. It\u2019s 2\u2033 wide blade delivers destructive cutting blows with a very sharp tip, leading to equally devastating thrusts. The Sage fantasy sword is not only an eye catcher, it is also a definite force on the battle field.\n\nAs with all our battle ready swords, the Sage is hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel. The blade has been dual hardened. The Tang of the blade has been hot peened over the pommel.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/uIGjrzukhX8\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTotal length: 49\"\nBlade length: 36\"\nCrossguard: 10\"\nHandle and pommel 10\"\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel\nFittings: Mild Steel\nWeight : 4lbs 9oz.\nPOB : 4\"",

The Elves fight against the Dark Lord for a millennium, sometimes winning decisive battles, other times bring brought to the brink of extinction. Only their strength that burns in their hearts seems to help them carry the day; their strength and the weapons of power that they create.

    "content": "The later Medieval period and early Renaissance was a time of significant development for weapons and armor. Not only were the materials used better quality, but smiths had the benefit of centuries of research and development thanks to their forebears. Designs became more elaborate without sacrificing function, aesthetics were elevated without compromising strength and integrity. Out of this period of time came the Gothic Sallet, one of the most interesting, complex and intelligently designed medieval armor helmets of the later part of the Middle Ages.\n\nGothic Armors were designed to imitate the pleated clothing that was considered fashionable in Europe at the time. These pleads, also known as fluting note, only rendered armors more structurally sound but were also visually pleasing. Darksword Armory\u2019s Gothic Sallet is forged with 14 g steel and fully lined (leather), making it strong enough for reenactment use. The articulating visor provides protection when in use, but can be raised for increased visibility. The leather liner is adjustable and also includes a chin strap, which allows for a range of fits and comfort on hot days at the Faire.",

Tolkien\u2019s works. For many of us, it began with reading The Hobbit in childhood, and some would go on to read his epic, genre-defining high fantasy trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Many people in the last twenty years have been introduced to Tolkien through Peter Jackson\u2019s film series, arguably one of the best translations of book series to film ever made. And who could forget the 1977 cartoon musical version of The Hobbit, which introduced a generation of children to Bilbo, Gandalf, Gollum, and the magic ring at the center of it all?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">However, even people who have read the Lord of the Rings books may be completely unfamiliar with Tolkien\u2019s originally unpublished work The Silmarillion. Which is a shame, as the vast majority of Middle-Earth\u2019s lore \u2013 including background information relevant to the Lord of the Rings series \u2013 exists within its pages.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The Silmarillion has been called the \u201cOld Testament\u201d of Middle-Earth. It details Middle-Earth\u2019s history from creation right up until the events of the Lord of the Rings. Many of the events in the Lord of the Rings seem to have deep historical meaning for the characters, but that meaning is not always revealed to the readers. In the Silmarillion these mysteries (some of them, anyway) are revealed as a rich and detailed history unfolds.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The creation of Middle-Earth at the hands of Iluvatar, the capital-G God of Tolkien\u2019s world, is not just a singular event. Iluvatar recruits a number of his servants, the Valar (small-g gods), to assist him in managing different aspects of Middle-Earth\u2019s formation and growth. These Valar are by and large benevolent beings, but one of them \u2013 Melkor \u2013 sees Middle-Earth as an opportunity to rule a world of his own. Melkor is the chief antagonist of the Silmarillion, and Sauron, antagonist of the Lord of the Rings, is his servant.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">While the Valar struggle to contain Melkor and his machinations, the Elves \u2013 first of the Children of Iluvatar \u2013 are born into the world. From a desire to protect these new inhabitants of the world the Valar gather as many of the elves as will come and bring them safely to live in the West, an island called Valinor. In these days there was not yet a Sun and Moon in the world, and Valinor existed under the light of two enormous magical Trees (Laurelin and Telperion). The elves in Valinor were kept safe and separate from the darkness of Middle-Earth and Melkor\u2019s evil.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">One of the elves who lived in Valinor was F\u00ebanor. F\u00ebanor (\u201cSpirit of Fire\u201d in Sindarian, the language of the elves) was one of the Noldor, elves who were clever in the crafting of metal and jewls. He was such a mighty craftsman of jewels that he was able to place the light of the Trees into the three Silmarils, gems of such surpassing beauty that all who saw them coveted them deeply. Unfortunately, F\u00ebanor became proud and jealous of his own works. He also listened to the whispers of Melkor convincing him that the Valar would one day ask him to hand over the gems he had created. This was proven to be true when Melkor slew Laurelin and Telperion, ending their light forever, and the Valar approached F\u00ebanor in a last-ditch effort to use the Silmarils to resurrect the Trees. F\u00ebanor denied them, and returned home only to discover that Melkor had attacked. The dark Valar had slain F\u00ebanor\u2019s beloved father and made off with the Silmarils himself.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">F\u00ebanor swore revenge, and many elves joined him. The first of the elves to create weapons of war, these weapons were tragically turned on their own kind in an event known as the Kinslaying. F\u00ebanor and his followers</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">attacked the peaceful coast-dwelling elves, killing many, and stole their ships to return to Middle-Earth to make war upon Melkor for centuries afterward. Many great and terrible things resulted from the wars fought over the Silmarils, and these events changed the face of the world forever. While F\u00ebanor was powerful and the greatest craftsman who ever lived, because of his deeds much evil entered into the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Despite the grim origins of the name, the Darksword Armory F\u00ebanor sword is a bright and beautiful weapon. A long, leaf-shaped blade shows the Celtic influence incorporated into Tolkien\u2019s elves, and when sharpened the blade rings with each cut as a sign of its solid construction. The attractive lines of the sweeping guard are perfectly proportioned to the blade, and the scent-stopper pommel provides the necessary balance to make this two-handed sword nimble in the hands. The 5160 blade is resilient and well-tempered, able to withstand the rigors of combat \u2013 even combat against the forces of Melkor. Constructed as a two-handed longsword, many European styles of swordplay would be appropriate with this weapon.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The Darksword Armory F\u00ebanor sword is a perfect balance of beauty and functionality, and would look natural on the wall of your home or in the hands of an elf-lord. We trust you will wield it responsibly.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;",

Tolkien\u2019s epic book The Silmarillion, F\u00ebanor was the most powerful elf who ever lived, so powerful that the dark lord Melkor was afraid of his might. F\u00ebanor was also the first of the elves to forge weapons, and created the first battle ready swords that were used by elves to slay their own kin. The F\u00ebanor Medieval sword is an inspirational piece based on Tolkien\u2019s creation. A two-handed weapon, the long, leaf-shaped blade is evocative of the beautiful designs of fantasy elves while the reach and heft make the F\u00ebanor sword highly effective at real-life combat. Make no mistake, this design is not only art \u2013 it is a functional weapon, equal of any of our other battle-ready swords.\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

    "content": "The Spartan Sword&nbsp;\n\nInspirational, Ancient Greek Sword\n\nFew tales of historical conflicts have stirred the imagination, have sparked patriotic fervor, or have galvanized the underdog within us all as the Battle of Thermopylae.\n\nIn the early 5th century BC Xerxes the Great, ruler of the Persian Empire, began his rule and set out to conquer all Greece. The Persian army at the time was purportedly one million fighting men, an unheard-of amount of soldiers, who would surely roll through defenses and crush resistance by lesser, decentralized forces (scholars dispute the one million number, but agree that the Persian force was vast by ancient standards). The woefully outnumbered Greeks met the Persians at the Pass of Thermopylae, and though they were brave warriors from an age of heroes they could not turn the tide. Finally the armies of the Greeks retreated, leaving behind a small rearguard led by King Leonidas of Sparta and his chosen 300. What followed was a last stand that almost defies description.\n\nLeonidas was King of Sparta when the Persian invasion began, and like the descendant of Heracles ought, he went to the Oracle at Delphi to seek counsel. The prophecy he received stated that the lands in which they lived would either be sacked by the Persians, or mourn the death of a King. Believing that he went to his death, Leonidas selected only men with living sons, numbering 300, to join him. These 300 men, along with a contingent of Thespians, held the narrow way known as \u201cThe Hot Gates\u201d against the Persian army. Before King Leonidas and the last Spartan died on the third day, more than 20,000 Persians had been killed and the bulk of the Greek army had escaped. This action allowed the Greeks breathing room to regroup, and a year later the combined forces of the Greek city-states routed the Persian army and sent them limping back to Persia.\n\nDue to the epic nature of the battle (and the epic nature of the one-liners exchanged by the Persian and Spartan forces \u2013 when asked to surrender their weapons, Leonidas replied \u201cCome and get them\u201d), the tale of Leonidas and his 300 has sparked films, books, comics, songs, and video games. One of the most famous of these is Frank Miller\u2019s 1998 graphic novel, 300, which was inspired by the 1962 film The 300 Spartans. Miller wrote this award-winning series in five issues that would eventually be adapted in the 2006 Zack Snyder film of the same name. The graphic novel (and the film itself) take considerable liberties with the story, though artistic license excuses much \u2013 this retelling of the story is considered the definitive version for this generation.\n\nOne area in which the comic series and film take these liberties is in the weapons and armor of the Spartan warriors. Unlike their historical counterparts, these fictional Spartans fight without body armor\n\nor the leather skirts that were standard issue, instead fighting in codpieces, capes, and helmets. The sword too was an original design compared to the historical weapons of the Spartans, though they appear quite fierce when worn by the Spartan warriors on screen.\n\nThe Sparta medieval sword is a very slick and maneuverable fantasy-style sword. Perfect for close quarter combat, this battle ready sword can deliver quick cuts and thrusts but truly excels due to its low point of balance. The short rigid blade offers an exceptional handling experience despite the flared blade shape while the sharp tip can deliver destructive thrusts. For fans of the film, the graphic novel, or general fantasy designs will love the look and feel of this sword.\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel. Dual Tempered HRc 60\n48-50 at the core\nGuard and pommel: mild steel\nTotal length: 27\"\nBlade length: 21\"\nBlade width at base: 1 1/2\" - 2.5\" mid blade\nBlade Thickness: 5mm\nWeight: 2 lbs. 5 oz.",
    "excerpt": "The Spartan Sword\nInspirational, Ancient Greek Sword\n\nThe tale of \u201cLeonidas and his brave 300\u201d has inspired many works of fiction, including poems and in recent years films and novels. One of the most famous is the 1998 graphic novel \u201c300\u201d by Frank Miller. This work featured a unique artistic style that was adopted into a 2007 film by the same name. The battle-ready swords used by the Spartans in the film is not historically based but still has managed to become an extremely popular among purveyors of fine quality swords. The Spartan sword is short and single edged. Narrow at the shoulders and widening towards the tapered and curved tip. The unique looking curved guard and pommel provide partial hand protection. This blade may not be a historical model, but would be deadly in the hands of any Spartan.",

There are also many surviving historical examples. The pointed or cone shaped visor resembles a dog muzzle or pig face and those terms became interchangeable in identifying this type of helmet as a \u201cHound Skull\u201d or \u201cPig Face\u201d Bascinet. The shape was for more than good looks; it was effective at deflecting blows and provide better ventilation and breathing. The visor has two eye slits and numerous breathing and ventilation holes on the right side and mouth area.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">An aventail (not included) can be attached to the brass vervelles or rivets that run along the bottom and side edges of the face of the helmet.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The helmet has a liner for cushioning and protection and straps to secure the helmet on the head.

    "content": "As warfare and weapons evolved during the years of the Renaissance so too did armor, and nowhere is that more evident than in the armor that protected one\u2019s head. Evolving from earlier bascinet style helms, the Sallet rose to prominence during the 15<sup>th</sup> century at a time when the Gothic style was becoming more prominent. They were characterised by graceful lines and a flared back which protected the neck, and variations of these helms would be seen worn by knights, footmen, archers, or crossbowmen.\n\nThis particular helmet is based on a surviving example from the 15<sup>th</sup> century that resides in the Wallace Collection in the Tower of London. While some Sallets lacked face protection, this one includes an articulated visor that can be raised for visibility or lowered for combat. It is constructed of Mild steel and features adjustable straps for a perfect fit. Strong and well-constructed, it would be suitable for reenactment or costuming.\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "Early in Peter Jackson\u2019s first Lord of the Rings film, <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, there is a scene where the four Hobbits \u2013 Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took \u2013 are hiding from one of the Nazgul. The four halflings crawl into a hollow under the roots of a great oak tree while the Nazgul searches for them \u2013 coming very close indeed. So close, in fact, that at one point it hovers over them, filling the Hobbits with overwhelming fear. The Nazgul remains shrouded in its black cloak, the only part visible is the iron gauntlet that it grips the twisted oak roots with \u2013 and even the slight glimpse of that gauntlet is enough to instill a deep sense of dread.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nInspired from the Nazgul medieval armor gauntlets in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we have created one of the most complex and detailed gauntlets on the market today. Each gauntlet has 158 rivets with 58 moveable parts, permitting exceptional articulation and range of motion. The gauntlets are made of 16 g steel (Leather gloves are included), making them suitable for reenactment, cosplay, or the Renn faire. The adjustable leather straps allow a perfect fit, letting you terrorize diminutive heroes in relative comfort.",

Out of necessity brought on by these moments of realization, the Gorget was born.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA Gorget is a piece of armor that protects the neck and prevents injury and decapitation. This particular piece is based on an artifact in the Wallace Collection, hosted at the Tower of London in England. It is based on the model of the medieval armor made in Landshut by Matthes Deutsch, circa 1480 AD, and is typical of other 15<sup>th</sup> century models. It is made of 16 gauge steel and suitable for costuming or reenactment, though we don\u2019t recommend putting its decapitation-prevention qualities to the test while wearing the Gorget.",

Many courtrooms displayed executioner swords on their walls. Their presence however was not solely symbolic, since it had a concrete purpose in the decapitation of the condemned. The blades of Executioner swords were typically engraved with vivid imagery of torture and punishment.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">These swords generally featured broad, flat blades that end not in a point, but as a distinctive flat edge. The blade is heavily decorated as many executioner swords would be; and while in some cases the sword would be inscribed with the executioner\u2019s name, in this case the inscription translates as \"I spare no one\" \u2013 a brutal message for criminals facing the executioner sword\u2019s edge.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-48928\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Executioner-sword-1349.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"553\" height=\"645\">Beginning in or around the 1400s, the practice of using swords for executions for capital offenses across Europe began to become more commonplace. It was only in the mid 16th century that specific swords would be used for this purpose as opposed to weapons of war. It is possible that the distinctive design of the Executioner\u2019s Swords was created to distinguish them from combat weapons \u2013 this was a weapon of justice, not of war. The last execution using an Executioner\u2019s Sword took place in Switzerland in 1868, after which mankind moved on to more \u201chumane\u201d methods of execution</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Stylistically, Executioner\u2019s Swords resembled broad, flat bars of metal more than actual weapons. This was due to the broad, flat blades that end not in a point, but as a distinctive flat edge \u2013 pointed tips being unnecessary as the Executioner\u2019s Sword would never be thrust. They could vary in length and would usually have long handles suitable for a two-handed grip and maximum force being applied to the blow. By necessity, the swords were kept sharp \u2013 far sharper than would be practical for battlefield weapons as they would generally only need to do simple, carefully aimed blows to the back of an unarmored neck. </span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Faithfully crafted after a later historical model that survives in the Medieval Crime Museum (Mittelalterliches Kriminalmuseum), the 'German Executioner sword' is an imposing and powerful piece.

Matthes Deutsch was commissioned to make armors for several prominent dukes of Bavaria, such as Friedrich III and Johann of Saxony. While most of Deutsch's medieval armour appears relatively simple, his ability to produce complex yet refined designs rendered him as one of the most sought after smiths of his time.

Dukes, Barons, and of course monarchs were hereditary positions, coming into power as a result of their birth. Other positions, though, were created by the monarch and entrusted to individuals of character. These were, at least not at first, positions that could pass down from father to son \u2013 they required individuals who were of sufficient honestly and integrity who could act in the capacity needed by the monarch.\n\nThe Viscount is one such title. A member of European nobility, who ranks above Baron but below Duke and Earl, the Viscount was basically a deputy, a trusted appointee. Individuals granted the title of Viscount were often responsible for collecting taxes and dispensing justice across the realm. This necessitated the Viscount, who acted under the seal of the Crown, carry considerable political and judicial clout \u2013 not precisely a position the Crown would want passed down in a family. King Henry VI appointed John Beaumont as the first Viscount of England\u2019s history in 1440 AD. While the position was originally an appointed one, by the Renaissance it had transitioned into a hereditary position with less power an authority \u2013 more of a symbolic role, as were many similar titles created during those days.\n\nThe Darksword Armory Viscount is a sword inspired by the individuals who were entrusted with the power and authority of the Crown during those late Medieval, early Renaissance days. The Viscount is a Hand-and-a-half battle ready sword that is conceptualized from various swords of the 14th and 15th century. The Viscount sword is forged with a type XX blade, the latest category in Oakeshott\u2019s typology. Type XX blades are long, broad, and sharply tapered as were many swords of the late Medieval period. The octagonal tapered pommel, based on Renaissance sources, is equally historical. For the hilt, we chose to take some creative liberty and fit the Viscount with an inspirational guard. The combination of these components produces a beautifully balanced battle-ready sword which offers exceptional handling capabilities wielded with one or two hands.\n\nType XX blades exist right at the junction of Medieval and Renaissance design. The character of these blades are broad and gracefully tapering to a sharp point. The Viscount Medieval Sword could have easily fit in the wars of the 15th Century, when armor had advanced to a level where regular melee weapons were of limited efficacy \u2013 the tapered points of late Medieval/Renaissance longsword would be able to neatly slip in between the plates at joints and other vulnerable points.\n<div class=\"single_additional_description\">\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

These 1/2 length leg armor are designed after those of King Edward the Third of England. the Leg medieval armor are made of 18 g. steel and ready to wear with straps and historical buckles.\n\nEdward III lived from 1312 to 1377. He enjoyed an unusually long reign of fifty years, accomplishing much. The king was an aggressive military campaigner, taking over his father and grandfather\u2019s conquest of Scotland as well as starting the Hundred\nYears War with France. England was ravaged by the plague twice within his reign and the king was able to restore society relatively quickly after both epidemics.\n\nEdward III was crowned when he was only fourteen years old, when his mother Queen Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer deposed his father. The two of them served as Edward\u2019s regents, during which time Roger Mortimer subjected him to constant disrespect. As a result, when he was only seventeen years old Edward III led a coup to restore his rightful rule. Mortimer was executed within a month of the coup despite the pleas of his mother.\n\nThe later years of his rule were marked with civil unrest and strife due to the king\u2019s failing health. Despite that, King Edward III is still considered one of the most successful kings in English history and has been compared to King Arthur himself.",

Hunting, cooking, and everyday chores required the constant presence of a knife or dagger to hand, and this need did not vanish as civilization flourished. These needs ran parallel to the need for weapons of war, and blades of all sizes evolved to become utilitarian tools for daily activity, hunting, self-protection, and war.\n\nThe Messer has perhaps one of the most \u201chonest\u201d lineages of any European martial sword. Unlike double edged blades that had a complicated evolution dating back pre-Roman empire, the Messer evolved separately from the single-bladed belt knife. In this way of all swords the Messer most closely resembles its distant ancestors. Literally, the word \u201cMesser\u201d is German for \u201cknife\u201d \u2013 and so too are the various versions similarly named; \u201cLanges Messer\u201d (long knife), \u201cGross Messer\u201d (great knife), and \u201cKriegsmesser\u201d (war knife). While versions of the Messer (and other single-edged swords) existed back well into the Middle Ages it was during the Renaissance that the name and current versions emerged as common articles of both civilian and military life.\n\nArming soldiers was among the most expensive tasks of an army, and as such weapons that could be made cheaply and quickly were most popular. In essence a scaled-up belt knife, much easier for a smith to make en masse, Messers (and their distant Medieval cousin, the Falchion) were common features on battlefields \u2013 Kriegsmessers were wielded by the Landsknechte mercenaries, for instance. Especially in the 15th century and following when civilian defence became more important, these weapons were also brought into common use among the general population. For the less wealthy you might find simpler designs with straight guards and less ornamentation, easy even for a country smith to make; for nobles or other aristocratic wielders the Messers would be functional yet decorated, often with handsome guards and scabbard to illustrate the wealth of the bearer.\n\nThe Darksword Armory Messer is a true brute, made in the spirit of those Renaissance weapons. This design is made as much for utilitarian strength and durability as it was for battle. Created for pure cutting, the wide blade of this battle-ready sword provides exceptional slashing ability. This model is based on a 15th Century design and features a hefty 21\u201d blade\n\nwith partial fuller and sharpened false edge along the spine back of the tip. Unlike other modern reproductions of the Messer design, it has a very attractive braided pommel and beautiful sculpted guard \u2013 clearly a version of the Messer that would look at home in noble hands. The distinctive riveted wood handle, canting away from the spine of the blade, completes the medieval sword\u2019s look. Balancing form and function, beauty and brutality, the Messer is a worthy descendant of every bladed tool that has passed through human hands. It will certainly live up to whatever use you will require it for.\n\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-30070 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/messer-sword-1352-sparing-340x340.jpg\" alt=\"messer-sword-1352-sparing\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCustomer feedback:\n\"What a great company!

Gross Messers (German for \u201cGreat Knife\u201d) look like scaled up versions of the classic \u201cBowie\u201d style hunting knife, were commonly seen during the later parts of the 15th Century.

During the latter part of the Middle Ages, jousting gained popularity in numerous kingdoms and was transformed into a lucrative event. Knights and nobles gained considerable wealth, prestige and land during such bouts, while merchants and artisans benefited from the \u2018games\u2019 by the distension of neighboring populations. While Jousting spread widely across the Christian kingdom, Pope Innocent II, in 1130, at a church council at Clermont, denounced all forms of \u2018Noble\u2019 tournaments and forbade Christian burials for Nobles killed in them. According to ecclesiastical ideas of morality, the \u2018games\u2019 distracted the aristocracy from focusing on more acceptable warfare, in defense of Christianity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Our Jousting helmet is based on the example found at the Metropolitan museum of art\u2019s collection.

Beginning in the 1340\u2019s were decades of death by one of the most virulent diseases in history \u2013 one that would kill between 75 and 200 million people before it had run its course in the early 15th century. The death rate in Europe was recently estimated at nearly 45-50%. Carried by diseased rats and spread to humans via fleas, it was a remarkably infectious and deadly disease, killing most victims within a week of infection. It was also an almost unimaginably painful way to die, as victims suffered with agonizing black boils and enormous tumors for days before drowning in infected lungs. These black boils may have led to the plague\u2019s most common nomenclature \u2013 The Black Death.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">To Europe\u2019s inhabitants, it seemed like the end of days \u2013 and it almost was. It was also a crisis of faith on an unbelievable scale that changed the course of Europe\u2019s culture forever. For centuries afterward The Black Death had a lasting impact on culture, drawing out morbidity and mortality as primary themes in art and architecture. Stark lines, images of deep sorrow, even specters of death grew to prominence during this period as Europe struggled to cope with a tragedy on such an epic scale. These themes spread across the continent and established themselves as primary features in many cities.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Paris was one such city, embracing gothic architecture and letting the suffering of the Black Death seep into its marrow in a way that never quite left. Indeed, one of the first examples of the Danse Macabre (a classical image of Gothic morbidity) appeared in Paris at the Church of the Holy Innocents less than twenty years after the last resurgence of the plague in Europe. It should be no surprise, then, that when faced with a public health crisis even centuries after the plague itself that they allowed a solution to blossom that was gothic on a truly inspired level. During the 18th century Paris was running out of room for graveyards, and the health issues caused by so many burials within their walls \u2013 especially the smell \u2013 that a solution had to be found. City officials decreed that graveyards would be emptied, and the remains were sent to a network of caves, quarries, and tunnels twisting and turning for hundreds of miles beneath the city.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">From this decision was born the Paris Catacombs. Within the Catacombs lie the remains of an estimated 6 million people, most of them skeletal. Unlike traditional burial grounds, though, the bones removed to the Paris Catacombs</span> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-21002 alignright\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Catacombs_of_Paris_16_August_2013_015.jpg\" alt=\"Catacombs_of_Paris,inspiration for black death medieval sword\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">were arranged with an eye towards Gothic sensibilities \u2013 as macabre a scene as you could ever find in all of Europe. Miles of tunnels are lines with artistically arranged skulls and bones combines with crosses and other religious iconography, creating a grim yet beautiful reminder of mortality. Currently the Paris Catacombs are a tourist attraction, though not one without risks \u2013 there are long portions that are off-limits and unmapped, and modern Parisians have gotten lost while exploring, and died alone in the darkness.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-21000 alignleft\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/paris-2156511_960_720.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"389\" height=\"258\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Black Death Gothic Sword was inspired by a journey through the Paris catacombs by Darksword Armory founder Eyal Azerad in April 2013. A classical 15th Century type XVIIIa longsword blade has been paired with inspirational guard and pommel to create a unique concept piece. The guard and pommel have been given a dark, almost sinister appearance to fit in with the overall theme of sorrow and death. The Black Death Gothic Sword is an exceptional take on the Gothic-era swords, and would fit as a historically-inspired collector\u2019s piece or as a weapon for cosplaying someone from Gothic-inspired fiction, such as a vampire hunter. In either case, we hope this sword will communicate the sense of fleeting mortality that inspired it.</span>\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-21001 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/skulls-1233643_960_720.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"757\" height=\"456\">\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

It does not participate in war and has not done for over two centuries due to the complexities of the Treaty of Paris. This has led some to conclude that Switzerland has always been a neutral nation or that there were no warriors in Swiss history. As countless armies on the receiving end of Swiss blades discovered, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages soldiers went through a period of evolution. While in centuries past soldiers were typically farmers, peasants, or otherwise employed individuals temporarily wrapped around a core of career warriors and nobles, the transition to feudalism and castle warfare opened up significant possibilities for those who wished to view war as a profession rather than a temporary divergence from everyday life. Few countries could afford a standing army, so those who wished to enter into a career of soldiering would often join a mercenary troop that would be hired to act as (or supplement) a country\u2019s own military. Of these mercenary troops the Swiss Reisl\u00e4ufer were generally regarded as one of the most fearsome and effective collection of warriors in the world.\n\nThe Reisl\u00e4ufer were employed in numerous wars and countless battles across Europe from a time encompassing the later Middle Ages well into the Enlightenment period. Their particular tactics \u2013 including heavy use of polearms, phalanx formations, and brute-force approach to infantry combat \u2013 allowed them to dominate on the battlefield. As their polearms protected them from cavalry and their training, armor, and large numbers often outmatched simple foot soldiers they were frequently the deciding factor in a war. The British, French, Dutch, and Spanish armies \u2013 to name a few \u2013 all would at one time or another rely on the Reisl\u00e4ufer to win the day.\n\nWhile the primary weapons of the Reisl\u00e4ufer would have been pikes, halberds, and later in their existence early firearms, many of them also carried two-handed, single-edged swords. The Swiss Sabre, or Schweizerdegen, was popular in Switzerland during the High Middle Ages and especially with those warriors of the Reisl\u00e4ufer. Unlike the \u201cSchweizers\u00e4bel\u201d \u2013 a modern term coined in 1914 by antiquarian and curator Eduard Achilles Gessler (1800 \u2013 1947) of the Swiss National Museum \u2013 the Schweizerdegen was a 16th Century saber using among Swiss soldiers and mercenaries. It is also the inspiration for this historically-based sword from Darksword Armory.\n\nLike all Swiss Sabers, the Darksword Armory Ring Hilt Swiss Saber has a single-edged, slightly curved blade. The tip of the blade is clipped with a false edge extending back to the stiff, robust spine that gives the blade its cutting strength and resilience. The hilts of Swiss Sabers were of various designs with some plain, others complex, with recurved quillions and rings and knuckle guards. By the late 16th century, specialized hilt forms begin to emerge, often with pommels shaped as a lion\u2019s head, or plated with silver. This design has a classically inspired renaissance-style ring-hilt, similar in form to early side swords and the two-handed ring hilt swords that appeared more frequently in the 16th century and following. This version of a Swiss Saber has a unique crown pommel to differentiate it from similar modern reproductions and to give it more of the renaissance character that the ring hilt implies. If the Reisl\u00e4ufer are ever again needed, this sword would serve them well \u2013 and would sure be a worthy member of your household/mercenary troop as well.\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

The early Danes \u2013 or those who would become the early Danes \u2013 inhabited Denmark from the late 5th/early 6th century and onward. Epic poems (including Beowulf, one of the most well-known Old English documents in history) make reference to the Danes as fierce warriors. And not without reason; at the onset of the 9th century the Danes \u2013 like others in the Norse lands \u2013 participated in the exploration, settlement, and enthusiastic plunder the Vikings were so well known for.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Danish Vikings raided, traded, and conquered their way across Europe, establishing settlements in England, France, Ireland, and across the Netherlands. Their shipbuilding and navigation skills were so great that they settled as far away as Greenland, and even made contact with the Americas. The Danish lands existed over a wide area of Western and Northern Europe in one form or another for centuries. As the Middle Ages progressed the kingdom of Denmark went through multiple changes in borders and leadership due to pressures and turmoil inside and out. War was not just a common feature of Denmark\u2019s history, it was a way of life \u2013 and other nations did not enter into battle with them lightly.&nbsp;</span>\n<div style=\"float: right; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Due to this fairly colorful history, the Danes became known for some distinctive weaponry, of which this Danish Two-Handed battle ready Sword is an example. This medieval sword is classified as an Oakeshott Type XVIIIe, a very unusual member of the Type XVIII group. While it is believed that some examples of this group may be German or Italian in origin, the vast majority of Type XVIIIe medieval swords have been found almost exclusively in Denmark. Sword scholar Ewart Oakeshott in his 1964 volume The Sword in the Age of Chivalry remarked, \u201cSo many of these swords have been found in Denmark (including one which belonged to King Christian I, 1450-1481) that it may be said they are a characteristically Danish type\u201d (p. 72). These Two-Handed Danish swords are some of the few that can be safely tied to a specific region.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The unique and defining characteristic of this type of sword is its unusual narrowed ricasso. It features a long, stiff diamond shaped blade with an extremely long handle, making it suitable for cut and thrust swordplay as many other swords were in the later 15th Century. Light and well balanced, this two handed battle ready sword has excellent cutting and thrusting abilities. Guided and balanced with the decorated globe pommel, the pointed guard can be used as a weapon capable of stabbing under the gorget and helmet, effectively defeating the opponent. The Danish Two handed battle ready sword\u2019s long, unsharpened ricasso can be gripped to shorten up the blade for closer work.

The sword itself is very good for thrusting, and has a thin, narrow blade. It is in fact so light that I can effectively wield it with one hand. It is by far the best sword I've ever bought\". - Z.

The Spear-Danes in days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness. We have heard of those princes' heroic campaigns.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n* the opening lines of Beowulf, c. 975\u20131010 CE<br />\n<br />\nThe country now known to the world as Denmark has a long and varied history as one of the oldest nations in the world. While it is currently a peaceful nation, it has its roots back past the Middle Ages to the Viking era \u2013 and beyond. In fact, the current monarch of Denmark can trace their family line back to the tenth century CE, which makes it the oldest monarchy in Europe. Like most European countries there are many surviving examples of swords and other combat artifacts, from the Renaissance on back. In order to truly appreciate the incredible weaponry that this culture devised, one must understand the tumultuous history of this great nation.\n<br /><br />\nGorm the Old is one of the most famous of the early rules of Denmark; famous in part because the current rules are his descendants. He became king after the death of his father, Harthacnut, who conquered western Denmark from the previous ruler. While Gorm\u2019s reign was relatively short, it was also quite active, as he conquered more of modern Denmark and set the stage for his son and successor, Harald Bluetooth. Harald and his brothers led warriors from Denmark (who were cunning shipbuilders) on raids across Europe, similar to the raids that were occurring out of Sweden and Norway. Thus, the early Danes were among the peoples known to the world as Vikings, and these warlike traits were carried by their culture into the Middle Ages.\n<br /><br />\nThe Danes of the Viking and Medieval eras were fearsome warriors, and as such Denmark's territory expanded greatly. By the middle of the 11th century, though, the Christianization of Europe was well underway. Denmark as a nation had ceased its Viking and raiding activities, and some of its territories (including England) broke away from control. What followed was a period of strife both internal and external as Denmark lost territories, won them back, had kings assassinated, suffered civil wars and split into three parts. Finally in 1157 CE Valdemar I the Great became king over Denmark, and set in motion events that would see massive changes come over the country. Valdemar rejected to rule of the Holy Roman Empire and established Denmark as an independent country; his son Valdemar II would continue reforms by instituting the feudal system and creating a code of laws \u2013 including the unprecedented step of allowing a parliament to be created. After Valdemar II\u2019s death the country destabilized again, losing two more kings to assassination and seeing borders shift and change.\n<br /><br />\nThe late Middle Ages were a time of continued strife in Denmark, defined by infighting and semi-successful military campaigns. When Valdemar IV ascended the throne in 1340 CE, though, he succeeded \u2013 though tactics both economic and military \u2013 in reuniting the sundered lands of Denmark under one banner. He spent his reign strengthening Denmark\u2019s borders and economy and stabilizing the monarchy until his death in 1375 CE, setting up Denmark in a position of power like it had never known.\n<br /><br />\nNow at its zenith, the monarchy of Denmark successfully waged war across Europe and expanded its borders well into the Renaissance. The Danes also struggled through, along with most of Europe, the civil wars that rages as a result of the Reformation \u2013 yet emerged relatively on top compared to the surrounding nations.\n<br /><br />\nIt is from this proud nation during the Renaissance that a distinctive sword design was developed. Replicated here by Darksword Armory as the Two-Handed Danish Sword, it was dubbed Oakeshott Type XVIIIe. Ewart Oakeshott in The Sword in the Age of Chivalry, \u201cSo many of these swords have been found in Denmark (including one which belonged to King Christian I, 1450-1481) that it may be said they are a characteristically Danish type\u2026 it does seem, on the whole, that sub-type XVIIIe is Danish\u201d (p. 72-73). This sword represents the culmination of centuries of warfare in a culture whose people fought for land for honor, and for God. Such a pedigree as this makes the Darksword Armory Danish Two-Handed Sword a fitting piece for any student of European history.\";s:14:\"_product_video\";s:0:\"\";s:19:\"_product_video_size\";s:0:\"\";s:24:\"_product_video_placement\";s:0:\"\";}}",

Tolkien and the films based on his stories. The Ranger Sword is hand Crafted with 5160 High Carbon steel, dual hardened to Rockwell of 60 at cutting edge and 48-50 at the core. As with all our battle ready swords, the tang is peened over the pommel. The beautifully detailed leather handle is accentuated by the unique pommel, making this one of the most recognized fantasy swords. The blade is forged with a deep full length fuller.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The D\u00fanedain Rangers are pivotal characters in the world of Middle Earth. Many centuries before the start of the Lord of the Rings series there was the great island kingdom of Numenor. The rulers of this kingdom were the human descendants of the half-elven Elros, a great lord and powerful foe of evil. The island kingdom was raised to be the stronghold of Elros\u2019 people, and for many years his descendants kept peace and were faithful followers of the Valar, the holy rulers of Middle Earth. They had great power and freedom, only forbidden one thing \u2013 to never sail into the west, and set foot on sacred Valinor. As the kingdom waxed in wealth and its rulers waned in wisdom they sought to challenge even the Valar, and set sail with a mighty fleet to Valinor. This fleet was utterly destroyed, and the island kingdom sundered and plunged beneath the waves. Only a small remnant was saved.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">This remnant became the Middle Earth kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor and were ruled over by Elendil and his heirs. However, some of the surviving Numenoreans left these kingdoms and travelled to the north. There, they dedicated themselves to the eradication of evil and the defense of the free peoples of Middle Earth. They became known as the D\u00fanedain Rangers, and despite their efforts were widely distrusted by the folk who lived in these lands. Their thankless tasks unnoticed, they nevertheless fought tirelessly against overwhelming odds. None of these Rangers were anything less than heroes, and none of them more famous than the one they called Strider.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Based on the sword of Strider the Ranger from the Lord of the Rings, the Ranger Sword is one of our best sellers. Made with Darksword Armory\u2019s usual attention to detail and sturdy construction, this two handed sword is an epic weapon to use against the forces of darkness.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Ranger Sword is a hefty inspirational two handed sword. The broad long blade delivers lethal, powerful blows aided by it's weight. The Ranger sword, at 4 lbs 11 oz, is by far our heaviest battle ready sword, mainly deriving from the large pommel and guard. Despite it's weight, the sword is well balanced, responsive and rugged. In a nutshell, the Ranger sword is reliable and virtually indestructible!</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6X_aRw7oQg\" width=\"660\" height=\"415\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center>\n&nbsp;\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

Favoured for its reach and devastating cutting abilities, the two handed sword gained ground as the most venerated weapon of the 12th and 13th c.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">It's wide blade and reach provided the knights with unmatched ability to break and penetrate the ever developing armors of the 13th century.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"> As single-handed swords became inadequate against the leather and mail armor of the 13th C. heavier blades with wider blades were needed to break the mail and cut through leather armor. Hence the one handed swords of previous centuries were gradually replaced by larger cutting swords of the 12-13th C.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Numerous variations are found throughout the European continent, establishing a general conformity and indicating a clear pattern of influence among smiths of the time. Variations are found in the Royal Armoury of Turin, the Imperial Treasury of Vienna, the Royal Armoury of Madrid and in the Hermitage, Petrograd.&nbsp;</span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">These two handed battle ready swords (12th century medieval sword) delivered powerful shearing cuts, and while large in size, they were still dynamic and responsive in their handling qualities.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The sword of the Templar was not considered a mere weapon, but a religious relic. The crucifix Guard served not only for praying prior to battle, but also as a counter block in combat. The Guard, individually crafted from mild steel and finely shaped with smooth lines, is further accentuated by the rich leather wrapped Oak handle.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The two handed Templar Sword is not only one of our best sellers, it is one of the top \"Staff picks\". Hand crafted and properly engineered for durability in combat, the Two Handed Templar Sword is a very solid, responsive, and surprisingly well balanced for a sword of this statute. The blade, hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel, is skillfully Dual Hardened for precise cutting while remaining flexible for enduring combat. In a nutshell, the Two handed Templar Sword is a finely crafted sword that is built to last !</span>\n\n<strong>Customer Feedback about the 12th Century Medieval Sword:</strong>\n\n\"Greetings, My new Darksword Two Handed Templar arrived today and I just wanted to let you know how pleased I am with it. The craftsmanship is evident throughout. There''s an Irish Hospitallers sword in our family, but not being the eldest son, it wasn''t passed to me. This sword is a very close representation of that one, including the simplicity, length and heft. Anyhow, I''m very pleased and will not hesitate to order from Darksword again.\"\n~ Ian Bennett, USA.\n\n\"I received my sword last evening and it has exceeded my already high expectations. It is pristine and wonderful. I will acquire all my future blades from Darksword. Feel free to use me as a reference. Very respectfully\"&nbsp; &nbsp;~William Edward Graf v. Ettendorf-ReBrook , U.S.A.\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel. Dual Tempered HRc 60\n48-50 at the core\nTotal length: 47.5\"\nBlade length: 36\"\nBlade width at base: 2.2\"\nWeight: 4 lbs 10 oz.",

Protective technology was likewise evolving and making life difficult for those attempting to kill individuals wearing the latest armor. Advancements in plate armor \u2013 both construction and materials \u2013 made swords less and less effective in pitched battle. Knights then turned to warhammers, maces, lances, and other weapons that could either pierce the best Medieval armor or transfer kinetic energy through the armor and into the warrior within. These weapons were so effective this could have spelled the end of the sword as a legitimate weapon of war.\n\nThankfully, the intrepid smiths responsible for the sword\u2019s ongoing evolution were committed to ensuring it would change with the times \u2013 and, as a result, we were given a gift in the development of the Great Sword.\n\nSwords were historically cutting weapons with the ability (in certain incarnations) to thrust effectively. Sometime in the 15th century blades began to change. Swords became more elongated with a more defined taper to the blade. By contrast, fullers reduced in length. This resulting in more steel being present in the tip and causing two benefits \u2013 it created a blade much more suited to thrusting, and yet it also moved more mass to the end of the blade causing it to be a shockingly effective cutter. The end result was a sword with massive presence, able to thrust between plates of armor and pierce mail links, yet also able to bring devastating force in the cut. Even though armor had advanced to defend against the sword, the sword rose to the challenge \u2013 and, as a result, we have centuries of excellent surviving examples of the Great Sword.\n\nHand crafted and properly engineered for durability in combat, the Longford is a very solid, responsive, and well-balanced Medieval sword. According to Oakeshott Typology, this sword would fit in the XIIa category. The Longford boasts a long, tapered blade common to 15th Century medieval swords. The Great Swords of history were often made with plain, straight guards and simple wheel pommels. We decided to give ours a bit more character - an attractive, curled guard, scentstopper pommel and deep fuller complete the sword nicely and give it a distinctive flair. Unique to the Darksword version of the XIIa, a stiff yet short ricasso provides additional stability and strength to the weapon. The blade, hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel, is skillfully Dual Hardened for precise cutting while remaining flexible for enduring combat. In a nutshell, the Longford is a finely crafted sword that is built to last!\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

Also known as the Great Sword, the Longford, named after the Longford Castle in Wiltshire, England, was used throughout Europe at the height of the medieval period. An essential weapon among the nobility, the Great sword was a powerful and reliable medieval weapon of choice against the pikes, spears and heavy cavalry of the late 13th \u2013 15th century. Greatly feared for its brute strength and speed, the Great sword became an essential weapon among the armies of the late medieval period. Wide blade, long and fast, the great sword became known as the first line of defense against cavalry and the heavy plate armor of the late medieval period.",

While art and surviving examples show us that many swords used in Scotland during the Middle Ages closely resembled the swords of England and the rest of Europe, distinctive Scottish designs \u2013 especially including a guard with down-turned arms, often flared at the tips. This design became closely associated with inter-clan warfare as well as Scottish conflicts with the English.</span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 130%;\">By the 16th century, the single-handed Scottish sword with its down-turned quillons had evolved into a basket-hilted variety with the same double-edged blade. The Scottish Basket-Hilt sword would continue to be in use even into the 20th century, and could have been remembered as the distinctive Scottish sword. However, as the Basket-Hilt sword developed there was a parallel evolution occurring \u2013 one that scaled up the double-edged sword into a long, two-handed sword. Both Highland and Lowland varieties appeared on the scene in Scotland, but it would be the Highland Claymore \u2013 with it\u2019s unique quatrefoil guard \u2013 that would most closely be associated with the Medieval weapons of the Scottish clans. While the first swords that would become known as Claymores appeared in the 1400\u2019s, the claidheamh mor name \u2013 meaning \u201cgreat sword\u201d \u2013 was not commonly applied to this two-handed weapon until the 18th century.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 130%;\">Claymores were fearsome weapons, capable of taking out even armoured foes. Its broad, heavy blade was capable of severing limbs, heads, and weapons from their owners. Some sources indicate that a Scottish warrior would advance while swinging the blade in a figure eight pattern, putting any who may approach at risk of decapitation. Even mounted foes would be at risk as a Claymore was fully capable of severing legs, even heads, from fast-moving horses. The Claymore became known not only for its presence in Scottish clan conflicts but in the ongoing border strife with English forces. Its brutal effectiveness is likely why this weapon was used well into the 18th century.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 130%;\">Based on an early 16th century sample, the Darksword Armory Claymore is gracefully engineered as a tough high-impact, yet impressively balanced weapon. The quatrefoil quillons are carefully crafted from originals on display in the Scottish National Museum, the British Museum, The Royal Ontario Museum and The Royal Armouries (Leeds). The blade, specifically designed to deliver devastating strikes, is elegant in its simplicity. The Claymore is a weapon evocative of the Scottish highlands, and the fierce clansmen who lived, fought, and died there.</span>\n\n<strong>Customer Feedback</strong> about the Claymore Sword:<em>\" I don't usually get romantic about anything, but when I held this sword for the first time, it felt like I was holding an authentic piece of history....The balance is perfect and it feels like it belongs in your hand.

By the 16th century, the single-handed Scottish sword with its down-turned quillons had evolved not just into a basket-hilted variety of the same blade, but also a long, two-handed sword with an unique quatrefoil guard.

Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, classicists like Robert E. Howard, even J. K. Rowling are well-known names in homes that do not own a single copy of any of their books. Television and film have elevated these authors even beyond the reach of their novels, and the fantasy fiction business has never been better. Some fantasy authors, though, never quite reach the heights of the creator of the Lord of the Rings \u2013 but have a dedicated following and expertly crafted books nonetheless. Of these authors, David Gemmell stands well above many others.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 130%;\">Born in 1948, David Gemmell was for most of his life a journalist. He might have remained a journalist had it not been for a brush with death in his 30\u2019s. Diagnosed with cancer, Gemmell felt crushing anxiety and despair. He externalized these feelings into his writing, writing a manuscript about a fortress under assault by an all-consuming evil hoard. The cancer scare turned out to be a misdiagnosis, and Gemmell shelved the manuscript for nearly a decade until a close friend urged him to try and have it published. The novel would become Legend, and would establish Gemmell as a solid contender in the genre.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 130%;\">David Gemmell would go on to write thirty books in the world in which Legend was set and elsewhere, and became especially famous in his home country of Britain. Unfortunately, he passed away at the age of 57, but left a legacy that influences the genre with his particular flair to this day. In fact, the David Gemmell Legend Award \u2013 given to rising stars in fantasy fiction \u2013 is an actual, honest-to-goodness axe. One of Gemmell\u2019s most popular sets of novels is the Waylander series, named for the main character.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 130%;\">Waylander is an assassin with a tortured past, having spent nearly two decades tracking down and killing the murderers who killed his beloved family. Now, he works as a blade-for-hire of unparalleled skill and questionable morals. As the books begin the land of the Drenai is in peril; their beloved king has been murdered and invaders have come to wipe their people off the face of the earth. The only hope the Drenai have is the assassin Waylander, who alone has the skill and the will to defeat their foes. But how can they rely on him when he is also the man who betrayed and murdered his king?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 130%;\">Like many of Gemmell\u2019s characters, the Waylander books feature strong themes of tortured heroes and redemption. How could we not make a sword honouring this character? The Waylander is based on the battle ready swords of the 14th century. The tapered blade, drawn with a \u00be length fuller, offers an excellent point of balance (P.O.B) to this one handed medieval sword. While the sword has a traditional Norman wheel pommel, the guard (being inspirational in nature rather than historical) gives the </span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 130%;\">medieval sword it\u2019s unique character and essence.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The \"Waylander\" sword is inspired by the spirit of the anti-hero. The blade is reminiscent of a standard arming medieval sword design, straight and double edged with a single fuller. The wheel pommel is recognizable on many classic pieces as well. What sets this battle ready sword apart is the unique guard - a fierce, claw-like design that is evocative of the darkness that covers Waylander's life and heart. The design is finished by a brown leather that forms the grip and covers the handmade wood core scabbard. </span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Dual Tempered HRc 60 48-50 at the core </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Total length: 39\" </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Blade length: 32\" </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Blade Width: 2\" </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Weight : 3 lbs 1 oz. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">POB: 3.5\"</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<div><center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/05mQL8Mb_sE\" width=\"660\" height=\"415\" frameborder=\"0\" align=\"center\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center></div>",

When wielded one-handed, they can be paired with a shield for extra defense. When wielded two-handed, they become brutally effective slashing or chopping weapons. It was this diversity that historically made them favorites of many swordsmen, and still attract collectors to them today.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The handle is long enough for use with two hands, but the balance is such that with enough arm strength it can be wielded with one hand at need. A long, wide blade suitable for heavy slashes also tapers to a fine point useful for getting through the chinks in an opponent\u2019s armour, especially when one hand grips the blade at the halfway point (a technique known as \u201chalf-sword\u201d). The graceful, curved guard and scentstopper pommel complement this attractive and practical fighter\u2019s sword \u2013 a classic design for modern collectors.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The 15th Century Bastard sword is a fine addition for sword collectors in general, collectors of hand-and-a-half swords in particular, or for modern students of the Renaissance sword arts for use in their training.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

Bastard Sword:\n\n\"This is the only battle-ready sword I'll ever need to purchase. Considering the price of this sword, the quality is unreal. We took it out for a day of testing, and it chewed through everything. Cinder blocks, bricks, tires, heavy plastics, metal sheeting. The sword barely turned an edge and had ZERO notching. This kind of durability doesn't happen by accident. Darksword Armory obviously understands their materials science. It probably won't be necessary, considering the quality of this sword, but if I buy another it will be from this forge.\"-&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>J. Martin., Ontario, &nbsp;Canada.</strong>",

Thanks again, I look forward to purchasing more medieval blades from Darksword Armory.\" ~ A. Randazo., &nbsp;New.Jersey, USA.\n\n''I just received the second of my two recent orders, the excellent Ranger's Dagger. Unlike almost every other Fantasy (book, movie, comic book) based weapon I've ever seen, you have produced an historically grounded, functional, honest to god blade weapon! It's elegant, lethal, and feels the way a fighting knife is supposed to feel. I went on a couple of&nbsp; very much not scenic tours during the recent nastiness in Afghanistan and Iraq. I spent more than a little time becoming proficient and employing modern blade weapons, and the balance, heft, and reach I had with my Ranger's blade of choice was very similar to those of your Ranger's Dagger. Only real advantage of my modern sticker was the more ergo grip plus built in knuckle duster, which might look out of place being wielded by a LoTR Ranger lol.I applaud your tremendous skill, your care and professionalism, and your efforts to provide the real thing to those of us who cannot realistically pay&nbsp; a minimum of several thousand dollars for a single weapon.'' -&nbsp;J.

From Homer, Beowulf, Icelandic Sagas to modern fantasy fiction, the sword is the foremost symbol of strength, leadership and power. Throughout history the sword conjures great inspiration, awe and respect. At different times in history the sword was considered a noble, aristocratic weapon, a weapon of war, and a deliverer of justice. The Roman Empire long considered the \u201cSpartha\u201d as a symbolic focal point of the Army\u2019s supremacy. During in the Middle-Ages, the sword not only elevated squires to Knighthood, but served as a symbol of strength, integrity and honour.\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\nIn modern times, representation of swords as a symbol of power endures. From Conan, The Elric Sages, The Chronicles of Corum, and David Gemmel\u2019s Waylander, the symbolic power of the sword remains. One need only look at the wild success of television and film series like HBO\u2019s A Game of Thrones or Peter Jackson\u2019s Lord of the Rings film trilogy to see how even in today\u2019s day and age cultures around the world still have an obsession with sword-and-sorcery fantasy tales.\n\nDarksword Armory has reproduced some of those swords from fantasy fiction, but our Guardian sword has a special place in our hearts. For one thing, it was designed and named by friend of Darksword Armory Jason Woodard. For another, it is a completely original fantasy design, not based on any from book, film, or television. Unlike our Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones inspired swords, the Guardian is unique \u2013 you won\u2019t find it anywhere else.\n\nThe name of the sword was chosen by former Factory X designer, Jason Woodard, who explained it as such:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>My Name 'Woodard\" was originally derived from the Old English words \"wode\", meaning wood, and ward \"Guardian\". In other words it was a name given to a forester, a guard, or a protector. An historical usage of the name goes back to the battle of Hastings, where one Commander \"Woodard\", was granted lands by King William for his assistance during the battle. I have owned my security guard business for over 15 years and enjoy hunting and hiking in the woods, so perhaps it must run in the family?</em></p>\nThe Guardian is modelled after late medieval two-handed swords, with a fantasy twist. A broad, flat blade terminating in a sharp point results in a weapon ideally intended for sweeping slashes, yet able to thrust when the need demands. The short, unsharpened ricasso can be gripped \u201chalf sword\u201d to this effect, granting greater handling capabilities. Individually hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel and skillfully engineered to take considerable abuse, the Guardian is a resilient, battle-ready weapon.\n\nWhat really sets this sword aside, though, is the dragon claw guard. The twin upcurled talons of a fearsome wyrm grace the hilt, simultaneously protecting the hands and proclaiming the savagery of its bearer. Dragons are yet another fantasy trope that are seen both mythologically and in fantasy fiction, and this sword evokes their powerful nature.\n\nThe Guardian sword is more than a mere fantasy weapon. It is a powerful, functional fantasy sword for the ages.&nbsp;\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

Inspired by the myths and legends of the fantasy realm, the Guardian is a powerful and robust sword for heroes among mortals. A long, two-handed cutting weapon, the Guardian\u2019s well-weighted blade is capable of cutting down the hardiest of foes. Forged from tempered 5160 steel with a beefy full tang, the Guardian is one of our most frequently purchased swords and may be the most popular fantasy design we\u2019ve ever produced.\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

The most common is the \"long\" sword, usually comprising a stylized anthropomorphic hilt made from organic material, such as wood, bone, or horn. The second type is a \"short\" sword with either an abstract or a true anthropomorphic hilt of copper alloy, such as bronze. The Anthropomorphic Celtic sword, is of the second type.\n\nThe Celtic sword symbolized power, strength, honor and the ultimate glory in battle. The fine quality and extraordinary skills required to produce these swords rendered them extremely expensive and, hence, reserved for the warrior elites and tribal leader. The sword was often buried with its owner or thrown in the ocean as a gift to the gods or spirits.\n\nThe Celts were a nomadic people who populated Europe and the British Isles from the 5th C., BC to 50 AD. From this diverse group the Scottish, Irish and Welsh cultures developed. Their artwork was distinctive and extended to their weapons. The Anthropomorphic Celtic sword is an example of such.\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\nThe Celtic sword is a short yet graceful weapon. As with all our swords, The Anthropomorphic Celtic sword is hand forged from 5160 High Carbon Steel and Dual hardened to a Rockwell of 60 at the edge and 48-50 at the core. The classic short Celtic diamond shaped blade is and exceptional thrusting weapon which has famed the Celts for their ferociousness and tenacity in battle.\n\nThe Celtic Anthropomorphic sword is based on two surviving examples found at the British Museum. Evolving from the Roman spatha, this style of battle ready sword combined a short, diamond shaped blade with a bronze hilt. The guard and pommel form the shape of a man, hence the name \u201cAnthropomorphic.\u201d The Pommel is the head and arms, while the guard represent its legs. The Celtic sword is a true testament to the Celtic people's artistic sense and the focal point of artistry which stands at the very core of the Celtic culture.\n\nTo create the Celtic Anthropomorphic sword, we carefully studied two original examples on display at the British Museum. Given the pivotal role of art for the Celtic people, we felt that our recreation of the sword should highlight this magnificent ability while preserving the swords primary function. Namely, being a well-balanced and functional medieval weapon. Superbly balanced at the hilt, the Celtic Anthropomorphic sword is not only a work of art, it is a deadly medieval weapon which staved off the Roman invaders through centuries of warfare.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17619\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anthropomorphic-celtic-sword-museum-2.jpg\" alt=\"anthropomorphic-celtic-sword-museum-2\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17620\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anthropomorphic-celtic-sword-museum-3.jpg\" alt=\"anthropomorphic-celtic-sword-museum-3\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17621\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anthropomorphic-celtic-sword-museum.jpg\" alt=\"anthropomorphic-celtic-sword-museum\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\">\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

His abilities as a warrior and tactician were proven time and again, though nowhere more decidedly than the <a href=\"http://www.britishbattles.com/one-hundred-years-war/battle-of-agincourt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Battle of Agincourt</a>. In this battle the English army, badly outnumbered by the French, managed to win a decisive victory thanks to Henry V's brilliant military strategy. While the English longbow was almost certainly the deciding factor in the battle, Henry V himself led his soldiers in melee combat against French troops while the French monarch - suffering from an illness - avoided the field. Though <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Henry V</a> himself would die from an illness in his mid 30's he maintains even to this day a reputation and a legacy as a great warrior, and one of the greatest Kings who ever lived.\n\nThis Henry V dagger is intended to be a companion piece to the <a href=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapon/medieval-swords/henry-v-sword-1325/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Henry V sword</a> (available at Darksword Armoury). Like the sword it has a wheel pommel and a matching attractive curved guard. The blade is made of 5160 spring steel and like all Darksword blades is tempered to a Rockwell of 53.It comes with a black leather wrapped scabbard with belt loop, and can be worn on the interlaced belt available when you purchase the Henry V sword. This is a well made dagger fit for a collector - or a King.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"single_additional_description\">\n\nTotal length: 17.5\"\nBlade : 12\"\nweight: 1 lb 2 oz\n\n</div>\n</div>",

Norman culture was known for ferocity and strength, which is probably why it spread its influence almost unchecked across Europe for centuries. Examples of Norman influence show up in art, language, religion, and especially in the relics of warfare that remain from this turbulent time.\n\nThis Norman Dagger is companion to our <a href=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapon/medieval-swords/the-norman-medieval-sword-1307/\">Norman sword</a>.

Like the sword, the dagger\u2019s blade is forged from 5160&nbsp;high Carbon Steel and tempered to a Rockwell of 53, making it just as battle-ready. For combat or everyday use, this Norman Dagger would be an effective piece for any Norman fighter, and would be a fine addition to any collection.\n\nTotal length: 17.5\"\nBlade : 12\"\nweight: 1 lb 2 oz",

A woman is receiving unwanted attention from a large, smelly man, and suddenly pulls a short blade from her gown or corset. If these scenes sound familiar to you, then you have probably seen the Stiletto in action on screen or in the pages of historical or fantasy fiction.\n\nThe Stylet or Stiletto originated in Italy during the 15<sup>th</sup> century. It is the smallest of daggers, easily concealed, lightest in weight, ideal for surprise attacks. Not meant for dueling or slashing, these daggers were exclusively <a href=\"http://www.thearma.org/essays/thrusting_vs_cutting.html#.V_PqougrKUk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">thrusting weapons</a>, with a strong triangular sectional blade to aid in punching through armor and flesh. The dimensions of the stilettos made these daggers a favorite among criminals and assassins, though they were later popular for self-defense. Darksword Armory is pleased to bring a functional Stiletto to the market, though we must request that our customers refrain from any assassination attempts with it.\n\nThe Stylet or stiletto is the smallest of daggers, easily concealed, lightest in weight, with a strong triangular sectional blade. The dimensions of the stilettos made these daggers a favorite among assassins. The dagger was easy to conceal, enabling assassins to follow their would be victims at close rage without being spotted.\n\nThis Stiletto is a reproduction from one on display at the <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Metropolitan Museum of Arts</a>.\n\nTotal length: 13 inches.\n\nWeight: 172 grams",

    "content": "The English Prince Edward of Woodstock, Prince of Wales, lived from June 15, 1330 to June 8, 1376. He is a well known historical figure; well known for his chivalrous (and occasionally non-chivalrous) actions, and for never being crowned king despite being the eldest son of King Edward III \u2013 he died before his father, and the crown passed to his son Richard instead. Edward would also later come to be known by a nickname of indeterminate origin \u2013 \u201cThe Black Prince,\u201d a name well known to scholars in the fields of art, history, literature and theater.\n\nThis popularity was surely affected when a sword that was discovered in the mid 20th century was identified by Ewart Oakeshott as the Sword of the Black Prince. Thought to have been stolen from Edward\u2019s tomb centuries earlier, became one of the most recognizable artefacts of 14th Century Medieval swords. The sword has a long, tapered blade that is ideally suited for thrusting, while still remaining able to make powerful cuts. The handle is elongated to provide more leverage, which in combination with the large pommel results in excellent tip control. The original has a Type XVa blade, which is faithfully reproduced here. Edward\u2019s \u201cBlack Prince\u201d title may have come from his distinctive armor, which according to some sources was blackened steel (although the title may also have come from his temper, mercilessness to his enemies or derision towards the lower classes in spite of his chivalrous beliefs). The pommel and guard of this sword have been blackened to reflect that title, and would match the dark platted armor that Edward may have worn. A black leather wrapped handle and upgraded scabbard completes the look. This is the first time that DSA has interpreted this popular design, and would be suitable for anyone who has an interest in Medieval longswords in general or 14th Century interpretations specifically.\n\nCustomer feedback about the Black Prince Dagger:\n\"... I just received your Black Prince dagger and it's great. Exactly what I was looking for, handmade, looks good, and historical character. And a nice scabbard as well. I'll be looking at your selection when it comes time for my next purchase. I hope you can keep making these quality weapons for years to come. Thank-you.\"\n- Rob S.

But more often it was the richly symbolic ceremony developed by the Church, which was tantamount to a sacrament of ordination into the status of knighthood. For the true knight had a vocation no less genuine and in its own degree no less divine than the true priest\u2019s or the true monk\u2019s.\u201d \u2013 from Thompson &amp; Johnson (1937) An Introduction to Medieval Europe (300-1500), p. 324.\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Knights, knighthood, and the medieval concept of chivalry have been a source of romantic and martial fascination for centuries. From classical literature to Hollywood films and television, knights have been frequent characters of note, capturing generations of imagination. While the fictional versions of these historical figures have departed somewhat from reality (as do all historically-inspired characters), the truth behind the fiction is still fascinating \u2013 and in some ways, worthy of the legends it inspired.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Knighthood, as a vocation, was a natural product of the feudal system. As feudalism \u2013 a system in which vassals or serfs worked land owned by others in exchange for homes, protection, and a percentage of the crops they grew \u2013 developed in post-9th century Europe, the roles taken on by the</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">landowners developed as well. Nobles and feudal landowners became increasingly entrenched as generational rulers as land, title, and office were passed from parent to child. As a result networks of these noble families developed elaborate systems of honor, fidelity, and privilege, including access to the best horses, armor, and weapons. The system that evolved to train youth nobles to fight astride horse, rule his lesser men, and bind them to the noble virtues to which he was born became as the years went on the overlapping rules of knighthood and chivalry. The very word \u201cchivalry,\u201d in fact, comes from the same Latin root as \u201ccavalry\u201d \u2013 which makes sense given the mounted knight being the main focus of the chivalric code.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Originating in Germany, the knighthood ceremony spread across Europe and was quickly adopted by the church as a means of educating and influencing those nobles born to a life of wealth and privilege. The ceremony often began after years of being a squire to a landed knight, learning the virtues and the practical skills of a knight. The candidate was given a ritual bath, clothed in a white tunic (to remind him of his purity) and a scarlet robe (to remind him of his duty to shed his blood for the Church), and instructed to fast for 24 hours. Laying his sword and armor upon the alter, he would spend the night in the church in prayer, after which the priest would lead him in Mass. Laying the knight\u2019s bared sword blade on the church alter the priest blessed it, took the knight\u2019s vows, and girded the sword about him before he departed the church. For the sword was the knight\u2019s most treasured possession, a symbol of his honor.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Early medieval sword combat was primarily oriented around cutting with a double-edged sword; however, as full plated armor was developed as</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">complex defensive wear for the aristocratic military elite, swords too had to be improved to counter this ever evolving defense. Unlike the sluggish and belated fighting that characterize modern misconceptions of medieval combat, the Medieval Knight sword was a well balanced and deadly weapon innate with exceptional handling characteristics. While the impressive cutting abilities alone made this sword a deadly weapon in its own right, the deep-seated taper allows the user to deliver assertive thrusts as well, making this an incredibly versatile weapon</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The Medieval Knight sword reflects the design and taste of the late medieval period. The double-edged blade is constructed from 5160 steel, has a deep, narrow fuller, and a robust tang. The detailed handle and clean fluid artistic lines of the curved guard indicates the early artistic influences, eventually explored during the Gothic period. This battle ready sword is quick, responsive and allows exceptional mobility in close quarter combat.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Historical knights may not have always lived up to the ideals of chivalry; indeed, it is certain that many did not. Knighthood became for these men simply a symbol of their privilege, and a justification for their actions. Nevertheless, we at Darksword Armory attempt to keep the ideals of chivalry alive in our hearts and work. This sword is our attempt to replicate the best that knighthood could represent \u2013 we hope it will be a symbol of truth and virtue in your home.</span>\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

Being more than a simple tool of war, the medieval dagger was used for a variety of mundane tasks, ranging from basic eating to leather working. The dagger however, although an important and useful tool, was a necessary weapon for both knights and soldiers. When swords broke or dropped due to injury on the battle field, the dagger was used for defense. When a shield, the small size of the dagger made it easier to slide through and thrust unprotected areas and armor openings. After the Battle of Agincourt, Henry V \u201cexamined\u201d the fallen warriors on the field. Those still living received a final blow by Henry\u2019s dagger.\n\nThe crusader dagger is forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel and Tempered to a Rockwell of 53.

    "content": "<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The British Museum in London.</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">800-950 AD</p>\nOne of the most coveted medieval swords among collectors is the Viking sword. Given the multitude of Viking swords on the market, one wonders whether the market is saturated. Many reproductions, however, play into the stereotype of Viking swords as little more than long cleavers \u2013 heavy, brutish weapons wielded by a brutal people. These reproductions fail to capture the spirit or \u201cfunction\u201d of the Viking sword as an important step in the evolution of the European medieval swords, from earlier Romanesque styles to the arming swords of late medieval period.\n\nA descendant of the Roman spatha, a longsword used by Roman officers, the Viking sword is a fascinating piece of history. Even during the Roman Empire steel, and the skill needed to forge long blades that were strong and resilient, was extremely expensive. Cheaper and nearly as effective were axes, Spears, or short-bladed swords such as the Gladius. However, advancements in technology and smithcraft allowed for the development of longer and more robust blades that could be made thinner than was previously possible. This meant less steel was needed to produce a sword, and though they remained expensive the ongoing development put swords in the hands of many a warrior across Europe. Central to this development was the Frankish Empire, specifically during the Carolingian era (9th century CE). The best weapons in Europe during the Viking age were produced in the Frankish Empire, and through trade and as a result of raids made their way into the hands of the Viking Raiders. Eventually, the Norse smiths themselves began to copy the techniques developed during the Frankish Empire, building on previous knowledge to produce their distinctive designs.\n\nThese distinctive designs stand apart from the later Medieval styles that were to follow, and can be uniquely categorized as a result. The most authoritative typology of the Viking swords was written by Dr. Jan Peterson in 1919. Focusing on variations in pommel and guards to formulate a 26 category scheme, Jan Perterson created a typological reference to determine the date of each subtype.\n\nThe five lobed Viking battle ready sword is the quintessential Norse weapon during the Viking age. The blade has the distinctive wide fuller and spatulate tip typical of designs from the Viking era. While using a Type 4 blade from the Geibig Typology, we fitted the five lobe Viking medieval sword with an extended handle that is long enough for both \u201chammer\u201d and \u201chandshake\u201d grip.\n\nThe type 4 blade, found from the mid-tenth century through the mid-eleventh century, features a slight taper and a fuller which extends the blade\u2019s full length. We carefully crafted this Viking medieval sword to reflect the Norse cultural and artistic heritage. Exceptional tools of war, the Viking medieval swords also attest to the Viking culture\u2019s keen interest in art and aesthetic beauty. This Viking battle ready sword features a 30 inch blade, forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel and dual hardened.

    "excerpt": "The British Museum in London.\n\n800-950 AD\n\nA distinctive, instantly recognizable design, the 5 Lobe Viking Sword is our modern remake of a classic blade. Inspired by the simple yet well-made work of the Norse smiths, the clean lines and subdued fittings of the 5 Lobe Viking Sword mark it as a weapon of a seasoned Viking warrior, not a king or a lord. Yet even this deceptively simple weapon shows the signs of the generations of steelcraft that made the Viking raiders so formidably armed. A wide, straight, double-edged blade adorned with a broad fuller and terminating in a spatulate tip marks it as a Norse weapon, the family resemblance to other Viking swords clearly apparent. The leather-wrapped handle provides a comfortable grip, and the polished steel fittings - including the 5-lobed pommel that gives this sword its name - are powerful, yet subtle. A weapon for a warrior on the front lines, the 5 Lobe Viking Sword will serve you well wherever your voyages take you.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-53943\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Warranty-Banner-434x800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"326\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

The blending of Norman culture with the pre-existing Anglo-Saxon heritage of the British Ilse (not to mention the Celtic peoples present at the time) represented a massive change on every level of society. The Norman peoples, descendants of the Norse, were a distillation and refinement of their Viking ancestors. Nowhere was this more clear than in the weaponry they developed, which changed close-quarters combat for centuries afterward.\n\nPrior to the 10th century, long-bladed weapons used in Europe fit into Petersen\u2019s typology of the Viking sword \u2013 relatively uniform blade types with different styles of hilt. The transition from these weapons to the swords of the medieval period took shape between the 10th and 11th centuries. While the blade geometry remained relatively constant, the main changes were a gradual transition towards a crucifix guard and wheel pommel. The geometry of the swords found from the 12th century clearly defined the classical examples of the Norman swords and image of the \u201cchivalric knight\u201d.\n\nThis transition did not reflect a new artistic flavour, but rather came from the shift from pagan to Christian society. The Normans were the descendants of the Scandinavian Norsemen who raided the European coastal settlements at the outset of the 8th century. Despite the Norman\u2019s conversion to Christianity and their adoption of Frankish customs, the Normans retained many of the traits of their Germanic ancestors and way of life.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-17600 alignleft\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/800px-Bayeux_Tapestry_scene57_Harold_death1-300x261.jpg\" alt=\"800px-Bayeux_Tapestry_scene57_Harold_death1-300x261\" width=\"300\" height=\"261\">\n\nIt is in this period that Ewart Oakeshott\u2019s typology begins to track and define the evolution of the medieval sword. Type X, the first type in Oakeshott\u2019s typology, represents the transitional design that links the previous style of longsword to the medieval designs. The Norman sword, sometimes referred to as the crusader sword, typically classified as a type Xa or type XI, had slightly evolved from a type X. Having a narrower fuller and slightly sender blade, the medieval sword of the 11th Century was still largely a slashing weapon, as its\u2019 earlier counterpart. It was not until the end of the 12th century that we see a more defined tip, transforming the medieval sword into a thrusting weapon.\n\nWhile the blade transitioned into a slightly more tapered and pointed tipped weapon, the cross guard and pommel were the main transitional changes. While the accentuated tip came from years of first-hand combat experience, necessitating a more functional tip for thrusting, the guard emerged as a change in religious beliefs (evocative of the Christian cross). The amalgamation of both transitions resulted in a lighter, more versatile weapon that allowed both slashing and thrusting during close quarter combat. The transitional crucifix guard turned out to be a defensive advantage over the Norman sword\u2019s predecessor, the Spatha. Not only did the longer quillons of the sword provided better blocking capabilities, it also provided the fighter a blunt stabbing weapon in the trenches of close quarter combat. The Norman sword\u2019s longer guard therefore proved more effective for both defensive and offensive functions.\n\nThe crusader sword (Type Xa) may have had a relatively conservative geometry, it nevertheless introduced a better balance and was more graceful in form. While generally, the same proportions as their earlier counterpart, the swords of the 11th c had more tapered narrowing blades making them easier to wield. This transition was not only due to the changing fighting techniques, from slashing to thrusting, but also due to the advent of heavier armour and cavalry.\n\nThe Norman Sword is finely engineered for the most discriminating collector. Designed for actual medieval combat, our staff conceived the Norman sword with a responsive, well balanced and resilient core. The hand-crafted blade, wheel pommel and guard have been designed from originals, conserving the authenticity and \u201cfeel\u201d of the originals. The Norman sword is not just a reproduction: it is a recreation of one of the most important swords of human history.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>The sword can be ordered in various scabbard options (standard, With interlaced sword belt, or Deluxe Embossed with Belt and bronze buckles)</em></strong>\n\n<b><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-67367\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Custom-Embossed-medieval-scabbard-Norman-sword-scabbard-800x552.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"552\">Specs:</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Dual Tempered HRc 60 / 48-50 at the core\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Total length: 34\u2033\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade length: 28\u2033\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Width at base: 2\"\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Weight: 2lbs 12oz\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">POB: 4\u2033</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<em><strong>Customer feedback about the Norman battle ready Sword:</strong></em>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\"Dear Eyal, Just want to thank you for the sword and dagger.

    "excerpt": "With its iconic crucifix guard and wheel-shaped pommel, the Norman sword (1000-1300 AD) is arguably the most recognizable sword in human history. The Norman or Crusader sword (Type Xa) is frequently depicted in medieval art including the Bayeux tapestry (an historically rich and important embroidery that depicts the Norman Conquest) and commonly exhibited in various Hollywood blockbuster films. Long studied by scholars, the Norman sword is what many people picture when they imagine a \u201cstandard\u201d medieval European sword.

It may be surprising for people in modern times, though, to learn that the Normans were once called the Northmen or Norsemen \u2013 and were descendants of the Scandinavian raiders known as \u201cVikings.\u201d Under the leadership of Rollo, a Viking raider, the Norsemen established control over an area of what would one day be known as France. Their control over this area was so absolute that they were granted ownership by Frankish King Charles III, called Charles the Simple, in 911 CE. The Scandinavian Vikings who raided the European coastal settlements at the outset of the 8th century had become not only landed immigrants, but title-holding nobility. <br>\n<br>\nThe Norsemen adapted to their new circumstances, and quickly, as Rollo himself converted to Christianity at the urging of his Frankish hosts with his people soon following. The Norsemen \u2013 now firmly established as the duchy of Normandy \u2013 began advancing at an incredible rate. Art, architecture, music, politics \u2013 no area of Frankish culture was untouched by their influence. Normans became known as paragons of Christian virtue and Medieval nobility, Even the local language was changed, becoming known as Norman French. Despite the Normans\u2019 conversion to Christianity and their adoption of Frankish way of life, though, the Normans retained many of the traits of their Germanic ancestors \u2013 including skill in battle and tactics.<br>\n<br>\nWhile many areas of Europe were invaded, conquered, or aggressively settled by the Normans (including the establishment of the Kingdom of Sicily), there is no more famous military venture than the 11-th Century Norman conquest of England. William the Conqueror, a Norman Duke, was a distant relative of Anglo-Saxon King Edward the Confessor. Upon Edward\u2019s death in 1066, William led a train of cavalry, archers, and foot soldiers in an invasion of the British Ilse. They soundly defeated the gathered Anglo-Saxon army during many famous encounters such as the Battle of Hastings. William spent the next six years establishing his reign in Britain through granting of land and title to the Norman nobility who accompanied him and the construction of castles throughout the land. The influx of Norman culture into the Anglo-Saxon regions caused vast changes in the lives of both groups, and still influences the inhabitants of modern Britain today. <br>\n<br>\nThe Two handed Norman Sword, is an excellent example of the quintessential medieval sword. Known for its crucifix form, it is a classic design that has both many surviving replicas and depictions in period artwork. This design was famously presented in the Bayeux Tapestry: an embroidery that depicts the Norman Conquest. The Norman Sword, classified as type XI with elements of type XIIa, is elegant in its simplicity.\nWorking on the Two Handed Norman Sword was a Challenging endeavor. Given the historical significance and popularity of Norman swords, the artists at Darksword Armory opted to recreate a Two handed version of the traditional single handed Norman swords depicted in the Bayeux tapestry. The Guard, being very symbolic, served not only as a cross for praying prior to battles and ceremonies, but also as a counter block in combat. The Guard, individually crafted from mild steel and finely shaped with smooth octagonal lines, is further accentuated by the decorated leather wrapped Oak handle.<br>\n<br>\nThe two handed Norman sword is not only one of Darksword\u2019s best sellers, it is one of the top \u201cStaff picks\u201d in their collection. Hand crafted and properly engineered for durability in combat, the Two Handed Norman sword, is a very solid, responsive, and perfectly balanced weapon. The blade, hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel, is skillfully Dual Hardened for precise cutting while remaining flexible for enduring combat. \n\";s:14:\"_product_video\";s:0:\"\";s:19:\"_product_video_size\";s:0:\"\";s:24:\"_product_video_placement\";s:0:\"\";}}",

Short for close quarter combat, light, and well balanced with a sharp taper and reinforced tip, the Arming Sword proved to be a devastating weapon again the developing full plated armor of the time. The heavily tapered and narrowing blade gave the sword devastating stabbing force against plated armor, while retaining its destructive cutting edge. The sword came to be known as the \u201cArming Sword\u201d because it formed part of the Medieval Knight\u2019s standard equipment. By the 14<sup>th</sup> C, the Arming Sword became the weapon of choice for many knights of the English, French and German empires.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-28197 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/arming-sword-design-darksword-armory-1313-1-275x800.jpg\" alt=\"arming-sword-design-darksword-armory-1313-1\" width=\"275\" height=\"800\">Classified as a type XV in Ewart Oakeshott classification, the Arming Sword is a one-handed medieval weapon. Although&nbsp; popular during the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> C, some sources suggest that type XV swords made their appearance as early as the latter part of the 13<sup>th</sup> century. During this period, sword geometry evolved to balance thrusting with the cutting geometry of previous periods. It was during this period that blade geometry began morphing more quickly as a response to the technological advances of the full plate armor of the medieval knights.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The blade is stiff and has a four-sided triangle-shape profile, with a diamond cross section, acute point and no fuller. The guard is designed for blocking opposing blows as well as to be used as an extension of the sword. The guard\u2019s sharp tip was designed to thrust through the visor and other openings in the armor in close quarter combat.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Such blades were popular from the 14<sup>th</sup> to the 15th centuries among the nobility for their resilience, light weight, dexterity and devastating thrusting capabilities. Due to their light weight and potent thrusting abilities, this powerful and effective sword went on to become the prevailing medieval weapon of the 15th C.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Over the years of doing research in museums around the globe, we have seen numerous variations of arming swords. One of the most popular being the one on display at the Wallace collection (A460) , procured from the Comte de Nieuwerkerke (count of Nieuwekerke).</span><img class=\"alignright wp-image-28188 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/arming-sword-medieval-museum-antique-historically-accurate-340x340.png\" alt=\"arming-sword-medieval-museum-antique-historically-accurate\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\">\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Being one of the most simple designs among single hand medieval weapons, the arming sword is elegant and unique; Simple, yet sophisticated. It\u2019s clean lines and elegance made it a prime sword for us to replicate at our shop.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The hollow ground blade made this sword particularly interesting for our staff. The shape of the hollow ground blade is paralleled on the geometry of the pommel and downward slopping guard, preserving a perfect sense of geometry and proportionality among its\u2019 individual parts.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Simple, yet refined, the guard had to be carefully ground to preserve crisp edges, clearly defining it\u2019s sectional frame.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Our creation of the arming sword is forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel. The full tang construction is peened over the pommel. To see a detailed video of our forge.</span>&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-28189 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/darksword-armory-development-designing-arming-sword-1313-one-handed-medieval-sword-2-340x340.jpg\" alt=\"darksword-armory-development-designing-arming-sword-1313-one-handed-medieval-sword-2\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\">Arming Swords were exclusively owned by the elite aristocracy, who were the medieval knight of the time. Their use was so common among the knights of the German, French and English forces that it came to be known as the quintessential sword of the medieval knight of the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> century. &nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Being specifically designed for close quarter combat, the Arming Sword handles beautifully. It is a very responsive sword that feels \u201calive\u201d and light in the hand. Easily wieldable even in novice hands, the Arming Sword\u2019s characteristics make it a medieval weapon of choice for all collectors. The sword is perfectly balance for swift movement and powerful delivery in both cut and thrust motions.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">While historically made for the noble elites, the Arming Sword is perfect for beginner and advanced students of the sword. Being perfectly balanced and relatively short, the Arming Sword has become a favorite among beginners seeking to perfect their form.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The diamond cross-section of the blade results in a thick spine that sharply tapers to the edge, providing good stiffness without sacrificing structural integrity. This makes the arming sword light enough in the hand to be wielded easily, yet resilient enough to withstand actual use in combat.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Arming Sword is a one-handed medieval weapon that gives little resistance. It handles very well with one hand use, permitting the use of a shield, for students of mode I-33, on the opposite hand. Arming Swords are known for being manageable and powerful with excellent cut-and-thrust ability.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Arming Sword has a very deep tapering, giving the sword an excellent piercing ability against chain mail and plate armor. The deadly thrusting tip can penetrate 18g armor, but is mainly used to thrust through opening under the armpits, gorgets, pauldrons, and other openings in the armor.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">While primarily a thrusting weapon, the stiff blade of the arming sword makes it an excellent cutter against pumpkins, water bottles and tatami mats.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Historically, the Arming Sword could be used with effectiveness against both armored and unarmored opponents. This was by design, as the wielder would face both armored knights as well as the lightly-armored infantry. As a result, the Arming Sword was designed to be a versatile weapon that would be able to suit a variety of combat situations.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">This version of the knightly Arming Sword is paired with a classic wheel pommel, one of the more simple historical designs. This style of pommel can be seen on examples well before the 14<sup>th</sup> C. While the design may be basic, it is anything but uninspired; a wheel pommel not only balances the blade and improves the handling, but can be used as a weapon in its own right. A crushing blow from the heavy round pommel of the Arming Sword could take an enemy by surprise, injuring them or knocking a helmet askew. The elegant curved guard is another classic, representative of several surviving examples of medieval Arming Swords.</span>\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-28193 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/arming-sword-tang-bare-blade-forge-darksword-armory-medieval-sword.jpg\" alt=\"arming-sword-tang-bare-blade-forge-darksword-armory-medieval-sword\" width=\"1280\" height=\"456\">\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Arming Sword is truly a delight of a medieval weapon. Easily wield-able and very responsive, it provides both novice and experienced users a very good performing battle ready weapon which will easily cut and thrust through most targets set against it. The Arming Sword is faithfully crafted from the original at the Wallace Collection (inventory .A460). Skillfully crafted with the same dimensions as the original the sword is responsive, exceptionally well balanced, and delivers forceful blows. The Arming Sword is finely crafted, classically styled, and a must even for the most discriminating collector!</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIGjrzukhX8\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>\n\n<iframe style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wTX03z6On0Y\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>\n\n<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dnfaZDFtMA\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>",

Short for close quarter combat, light, and well balanced with a sharp taper and reinforced tip, the Arming Sword proved to be a devastating weapon again the developing full plated armor of the time. The heavily tapered blade gave the sword devastating stabbing force against plated armor, while retaining its destructive cutting edge. The sword came to be known as the \u201cArming Sword\u201d because it formed part of the Medieval Knight\u2019s standard equipment.

    "content": "The orcs are coming. The heroes are surrounded. All hope seems lost \u2013 until with a mighty bellow, the barbarian warrior clears a path to safety with his improbably large axe. The day is saved thanks to the barbarian\u2019s mighty thews, and his mightier axe. If the above scene sounds familiar to you, then you will probably also recognise this axe. In television, in movies, in video games and in tabletop RPG\u2019s the fearsome barbarian reigns supreme. Often the party\u2019s \u201ctank\u201d or damage-absorber, the barbarian is at the forefront of combat at all times \u2013 and often wields a weapon like this. Two-headed axes were not common historically due to the fact that if your attack bounces off of an opponent\u2019s armor it means an equally heavy and sharp axe head is probably headed straight back at you. However, in fantasy many weapons that are impractical get a pass due to the \u201crule of cool.\u201d The two-headed Barbarian fantasy axe is one such weapon. This axe is an incredible feat of smith work and craft. Weighing a total of 12 lbs (!), the axe is 48 inches long and has two equal sized, crescent-shaped heads. While we don\u2019t recommend using it for combat, it is as battle-ready as every other product in our catalogue. It would certainly turn heads at the renn faire or make an imposing centrepiece to your collection \u2013 assuming you can find hooks big enough to keep it on your wall.",

The Viking raids, leaving countless lifeless bodies and villages in ruin were recorded throughout the European continent. Despite this reputation, the relics that remain of their culture give insight into a remarkably different culture. The axes of the Vikings are at times decorated with intricate, artistic designs and carefully created knotwork. Even the weapons that survive show a level of attention to detail that runs counter to the popular perception of Vikings as barbarians.\n\nThis Viking axe sits at the balance point between form and function. It has the typical, well-weighted blade of a Viking war axe, suitable for heavy cuts and smashing through an opponent\u2019s guard.\n\nThe axe is one of the first tools to be manufactured by humankind.

The Icelandic Sagas and Kings' Sagas present some of the most culturally rich and elaborate accounts of Viking life. Through them, we learn of Norse customs, traditions, and beliefs. At the forefront of this culture is the consideration of art as a central focal point in Norse life.\n\nThe Vikings raided and colonized wide areas of Europe between the 9th and 11th centuries. Whereas the initial motives for the migrations are unknown, historians unanimously agree that their disruptive influence profoundly affected European political history and trade.\n\nWidely recognized as superior craftsmen, the Vikings created remarkable Jewelry, Weapons and ships, known as <em>Drakkars</em> or <em>Knarrs</em>. The Ships were not only constructed for functionality, but as a work of art. Viking ships were embedded with anthropomorphic figures, providing insight into their beliefs and superstitions. The Viking love of riddling phrases and schemes of rhyme yielded a rich poetic tradition. This tradition found itself not only in their poetry, but also on their ships, weapons and jewellery.\n\nAt the center of this fierce nomadic culture stood the Viking sword. Featuring a broad blade with a deep fuller, the two-handed Viking sword is a testament to the fierce Viking culture depicted in the Various Icelandic sagas.\n\nSturdy and resilient, the two-handed Viking sword is everything a Viking weapon <em>should</em> be: brutish, resilient and built to last. Individually crafted by our staff, the two-handed Viking sword is a testament to the warrior life and artistry of the Nordic peoples.\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

The film re-imagined the story of Beowulf as told by an Arabic poet, who starts his journey as an ambassador and ends it in the company of Viking warriors fighting off an almost supernatural foe. The movie was plagued by production problems and baffled moviegoers and critics alike, especially when Antonio Bandaras \u2013 a fine actor, but a Spanish one \u2013 was cast as the Arabic poet.\n\nIt crashed at the box office but gained a cult following, especially for its fighting scenes and for the mighty Viking warrior Buliwyf with his massive (probably not historical) two handed Viking sword.&nbsp; Opinions among Darksword staff are sharply (heh) divided as to if the film is any good. We leave it to you to decide - if you\u2019d like to see a movie with an Arab played by a Spaniard, Vikings played by Scotsmen, and Bears played by naked men in body paint, this is the B-List movie for you.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-53943\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Warranty-Banner-434x800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\" height=\"371\">Pommel &amp; Guard : Bronze\nTotal length: 40\u201d\nBlade length: 30\u201d\nBlade Width: 2\u201d\nWeight: 2 lbs 12 oz\nPOB: 4\"",

The symbols on a knight\u2019s shield were his heraldry, a complex set of designs (also called armory or armorial bearings) that detailed his origins and allegiance. Knights would wear the healdric devices of their lords and so represent them \u2013 in battle, in the tournament, and abroad in war or crusade. The wearing of heraldry on one\u2019s shield is strongly associated with a knight\u2019s honor and chivalric virtue.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">By contrast, a Black Knight is someone who does not display heraldry. For reasons of his or her own, the Black Knight adopts a set of unmarked arms (by literary tradition, typically blacked armor, tunic, and shield at least) and refuses to disclose their identity. In many pieces of classical and modern fiction the Black Knight is therefore a villainous character, unwilling to stand behind their actions but defiantly standing in the path of the hero.</span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">While some historical figures (notably Scottish knight James Stewart) took the title of \u201cThe Black Knight,\u201d the trope itself may have originated with Arthurian legend. In Sir Thomas Malory\u2019s unparalleled 15th-century classic, Le Morte d'Arthur, the character of the Black Knight appears and faces Sir</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Gareth. Gareth, nephew of King Arthur and Knight of the Round Table, has the story of his journey to become a knight detailed in Le Morte d'Arthur \u2013 during which time he defeats the Black Knight as well as several other villainous knights on his journey. Sir Gareth remains a major character in the story until his death at the hands of Sir Lancelot during Lancelot\u2019s brief rebellion against King Arthur, though the story of Gareth overcoming his foes (including the Black Knight) remains a major feature of the book.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Several other Black Knights appear in different versions of Arthurian legend, and we would be remiss if we did not include the most famous version here. In 1975 comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, King Arthur (played by Graham Chapman) faces a fearsome Black Knight (played by John Cleese) guarding a \u201cbridge\u201d (played by a short wooden plank). The ensuing swordfight is famous even among those who do not typically enjoy the British comedy troupe\u2019s humor, as King Arthur cuts off the Black Knight\u2019s limbs one by one while the Black Knight comically refuses to acknowledge the severity of his wounds. The scene must be seen to be appreciated, so we have linked it here will all respect to the filmmakers and encourage everyone reading to purchase or rent a copy of the film.</span>\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s35rVw1zskA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Inspired by Black Knights both real and fictional, The Black Knight Sword is a highly unique weapon. The design of the weapon was inspired by E.A. Christensen\u2019s famous sketch, found on p. 121 of Oakeshott\u2019s \u201cRecord of the Medieval Sword.\u201d The distinctive pommel married to the classic double-edged, single-fullered blade makes this a knightly weapon of note. While preserving the historical essence of the blade and pommel, our rendition of this battle ready sword was given a fantasy appearance with its morbid and savage-looking crossguard.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Structurally, the Black Knight Sword is built to our usual standards of strength and resilience. The sword's blade is responsive, well balanced, tough yet flexible. The sword\u2019s light weight and balance make this medieval sword a potent thrusting weapon. The dual tempered 5160 steel blade is solid and extends though the grip with a full tang. Classically styled with the typically close quarter blades of the 14th and 15th C, the Black Knight is similar to many swords that would have been carried by mounted noble-born warriors. What sets it apart beyond the stylistic guard is the richly decorated pommel, which crowns an equally embellished leather wrapped handle.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Inspiring an essence of strength and heroism, the Black Knight sword is a must even for the most discriminating collector.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

    "excerpt": "<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">In history and literature, a Black Knight is a mysterious warrior who hides their identity in order to disguise their motives and allegiance. The Darksword Armory Black Knight Sword is a nod to this literary and historical character, blending historical design with a fantasy flare. The straight, tempered, double-edged blade is based on those swords most often carried by the mounted knights of the medieval period. With full tang construction this sword is fully functional, and has been expertly forged and balanced to be an effective and deadly cutting weapon.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">More information on the Black Knight Sword, and on the historical and fictional characters that inspired it, can be found below.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

This popular misconception was perpetrated over the last 80 years by Wagner operas and Hollywood films full of blond-bearded Thor lookalikes wearing horned helmets. Over the last two decades however, collectors and sword enthusiasts who study Viking culture widely recognize these beliefs as false. Many remaining Viking swords are not only functional, but beautifully decorated, and often lighter and more lively than expected. This may be because some of those weapons were not meant for musclebound comic book heroes, but may in fact have been meant for women \u2013 the Shield-maidens.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The existence of Shield-maidens, or Skjaldm\u00e6r in the Norse language, is hotly debated among historians. Some argue that there is little historical evidence that women were trained and active members of Norse fighting units. Others, like archaeologist Dr. Neil Price (author of the widely acclaimed book <em>The Viking Way</em>), argue that the archaeological evidence speaks for itself \u2013 numerous texts speak of Shield-maidens engaging in combat and being fearsome warriors, and some artistic remnants from the Viking age depict women warriors with weapons and armor. While it is possible that these depictions were meant to represent the Valkyrie \u2013 supernatural servants of Odin who escorted fallen warriors to the afterlife \u2013 there have now also been several archaeological finds involving Norse women buried as warriors. In some of these cases, the Viking women were buried with swords as beautiful and deadly as the women who carried them.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">One such example is an elegant 11 th C. Viking sword, found buried next to the body of a Viking woman in Finland. Known as the Suontaka sword (named for the village near which it was found), it is a startling example of 11<sup>th</sup> century Viking sword design. Interestingly however, little is known about the sword, its maker, and the Viking woman it was made for. While the remarkable grace and detail suggest a person of high rank or status, no clues attest as to who exactly this Shield-maiden was.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Exquisitely crafted, the 11th C. Suontaka Viking sword is the finest of its kind. The elegantly carved knot-work on the guard and pommel reflect the height of Viking art. The pommel type according to the Petersen Typology is AE, known for being intricately decorated. Mirroring the dragon-prowed ships of the raiding Norsemen, the guard and pommel show the scrolling knots of dragons in interlocking loops. From the beginning we at Darksword Armory knew that reproducing this sword was going to require all the skills at our disposal.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">While working on the guard and pommel, considerable attention was given to the detailed knot work associated with the sword. Darksword Armory\u2019s initial step in making this piece was to study original photographs of the medieval sword. We then magnified the photographs allowing our staff to recreate this beautiful piece. The blade has a deep, crisp fuller typical among Viking swords of the period, impeccably complimenting the intricate hilt design. The broad, stiff blade is suitable for the sort of combat that Viking warriors and Shield-maidens would engage in \u2013 sweeping one-handed cuts and slashes, paired with the classic circular Viking shield.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Suontaka sword may have belonged to a Shield-maiden. Female warriors may or may not have been commonplace in Norse society. Regardless, the Darksword Armory 11<sup>th</sup>-Century Viking Sword would be suitable for warriors of any gender. Balancing form and function, danger and beauty, this battle-ready Viking Sword would be suitable for anyone who wants to carry on the spirit of the Viking warriors \u2013 and the Shield-maidens who fought alongside them.</span>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17562\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thumbs_2c3963bc08cf43b40ad41d56fc4a93d7.jpg\" alt=\"Viking Sword Handle\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17560\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thumbs_a42b1adf6e5ead999fc492408772b85b.jpg\" alt=\"viking-sword-old\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\"> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17561\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thumbs_e05d0de77b6092c2f64f724571fe2630.jpg\" alt=\"viking-sword-old-pommel\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\">\n\n5160 High Carbon Steel Differential\nHardening : 60 Rockwell at the Edge\n50 At the Core\nFittings: Bronze\nTotal Length: 36\"\nBlade length: 30\"\nBlade width at base: 2\"\nblade thickness: 1.48 mm\nWeight: 2 lbs 11 oz",

Although eldest son of King Edward III, The Black Prince was never crowned king \u2013 Dead before his father, the crown passed to his son Richard instead.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Since the 16th C. Edward of Woodstock came to be popularly dubbed as \u201cThe Black Prince.\u201d A name more recognized for Edward\u2019s legacy, possibly issued from his black (blued) armour. This title may also have come from his temper, lack of mercy and derision towards the lower classes, in spite of his chivalrous beliefs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The popularity of Edward III\u2019s sword was surely affected when a medieval sword, discovered during the mid-20th century, was identified by Ewart Oakeshott as the sword of the Black Prince. Thought to have been stolen from Edward\u2019s tomb centuries earlier, The Black Prince sword became one of the most recognizable artefacts of 14th Century. Simply yet elegant in form, the Black Prince sword reflected the</span>\n\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-30086 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fiore-dei-Liberi-340x340.jpg\" alt=\"fiore-dei-Liberi\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\">\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;aesthetic direction of favouring clean crisp lines.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">With the progress of the full plated armour of the mounted knight,&nbsp; blade smiths began manufacturing longer two handed sword blades &nbsp;that were stiff instead of flexible, with a diamond cross sections that would reinforce the tip. These swords, engineered to thrust through the gaps in armour, revolutionized medieval warfare techniques during later part of the middle ages. Previous sword types, engineered with an emphasis on cutting, were unable to inflict more than percussive damage against the armoured knight. Hence, the advent of the type XVa longswords became the most essential part of the medieval Knight\u2019s arsenal. The stiff diamond shaped hollow ground needle tip blade was not only capable of powerful cuts, but offered exceptional advantages with their keen ability to pierce through the ever developing plate armour.&nbsp; With its diamond shaped hollow ground cross-sectional blade, the Black Prince sword is representative of the changing role of the sword on the battle battlefield.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">From the 14<sup>th</sup> C. onwards, the sword began to be used not just as a battlefield weapon, but as a civilian weapon as well. Starting in Germany and then Italy, sword masters such as Johannes Liechtenauer (late 14<sup>th</sup>c)&nbsp; and Fiore dei Liberi (c.1340-1420) trained students in the use of the sword, not on the battlefield but in the judicial duel against unarmoured and armoured opponents. With the type XVa We see the development of a true cut-and-thurst sword and one of the most successful sword types in Europe. In a period where art, status and functionality was of prime importance, the XVa longsword was a coveted weapon of war and social status.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">During the preliminary steps of the making of the Black Prince sword, we set out to create a medieval sword worthy of the aristocracy. We set to design the sword with minimalist and clean lines while preserving the historical character of the guard and pommel . &nbsp;&nbsp;While great importance was bequeathed to the elegance and symmetry of the fittings, considerable attention was set on the blade\u2019s performance, flex and balance. &nbsp;These elements easily made the Black Prince sword a favorite among our customers. Not only for its exceptional handling characteristics but also for its elegance and simplicity.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-30087 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/unassembled-black-prince-sword-darksword-tang-340x340.jpg\" alt=\"unassembled-black-prince-sword-darksword-tang\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\">Being an historical piece, we carefully examined the original in April 2016 at the Royal Armoury in Leeds, England. While creativity was kept to a minimum, given the historical character, we wanted the sword to have a deep hollow ground diamond shape blade specifically designed to penetrate plate armour with searing strength.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Its resilient hollow ground blade provides this sword outstanding thrusting force and an extraordinary balance.

Specifically engineered for armoured combat, we wanted the Black Prince sword to have superb handling capabilities, an exceptional response and a very good PoB (point of balance). Despite its long blade and size, the Black Prince is an exceptionally easy sword to handle for both experienced and amateur sword enthusiasts.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The sword is a very responsive sword that feels \u2018alive\u2019 and light in the hand. Easily wieldable even in novice hands, the Black Prince sword\u2019s characteristics make it a medieval weapon of choice for all collectors. The sword is perfectly balance for swift movement and powerful delivery in both cut and thrust.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Authentic in every detail, the Black Prince sword is individually hand forged from 5160 High Carbon Steel and Dual hardened to a Rockwell of 60 at the edge and 48-50 at the core.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Refined yet of elegant simplicity, the Black Prince sword is in a class by itself. Light, responsive and classically styled, the Black Prince sword delivers what it was designed to do !

Type X Sword, dedicated to the cut as opposed to the thrust, became the norm. Slightly more tapered than the swords preceding the 13th C, type X medieval sword displayed a shorter fuller, which improved the sword's mass distribution. This newly engineered blade resulted in a sword capable of cutting as its predecessors, yet superior in the thrust.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Based on the swords of the late 13th, century, the Type X medieval sword is an interesting example. While the straight guard and the Type X blade (Oakeshott) was not an unlikely pairing, the fitting of a \u201cBrazil Nut\u201d pommel, seen mainly on medieval swords of Germanic regions of Europe, makes this weapon unique in its own right.</span>\n\n<center><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"713\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</iframe></center><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Sword Typology is, as the saying goes, more of an art than a science. Distinguishing categories of swords when the differences are often so subtle can be extremely challenging, and as a result several different systems of classification exist. Earlier swords \u2013 those from the Viking era \u2013 were typically classified according to Elis Behmer or Jan Petersen\u2019s typologies. Petersen\u2019s typology, the most widely used by students of Norse art and weaponry, utilized Roman numerals to classify the varieties of Viking swords. Later, sword scholar Ewart Oakeshott would continue Petersen\u2019s typology into categorizing the wide variety of medieval swords from European history.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Type X is the first sword in Oakeshott\u2019s typology and the last sword in Petersen\u2019s. As Oakeshott himself said in his book \u201cThe Sword in the Age of Chivalry,\u201d</span>\n<blockquote><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">I have tried to work out some simple way of clearly differentiating my own Type X (ten) from Petersen\u2019s Type X, but nothing can really be done. Perhaps the crossing, as it were, of the two typologies at this point, at a sword-type common to both, may be regarded as a pivot around which the two may swing in harmony (p. 28).</span></blockquote>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">This makes clear the importance of the Type X \u2013 as a transitional weapon, it marks the changeover from weapons of Viking design and origin to the weapons of the Middle Ages. Like Viking swords it has a broad, flat blade with a long fuller; unlike the Viking swords it had a cruciform hilt.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Type X swords that have been recovered typically were constructed with a wheel-shaped pommel. However, an alternate version of the Type X was frequently depicted in art (and many surviving examples) with an oval-shaped pommel usually called a \u201cBrazil-nut\u201d pommel. This variation was very popular in Germanic regions as it appeared regularly in manuscript illustrations and art from that area. The image below, also from Oakeshott\u2019s \u201cThe Sword in the Age of Chivalry,\u201d (p. 30) is one such example.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The Type X swords are among the most common surviving specimens of all medieval weapons. Various examples are currently on display at the Tower of London, The Brittish Museum, The Walllace Collection, The Musee de l'armee and the Royal Ontario Museum.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Being widely coveted among serious collectors, we chose to recreate one of the most opulent examples of the type X swords. Elegantly designed, with aesthetically balanced Brazil-nut pommel and guard, the Type X is classically styled to complete any collection.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Made to our standards of quality and durability, the Type X sword is built to last.

Henry V\u2019s sword is not only remembered for being a <em>sword of kings</em>, but also remembered as the iconic weapon in&nbsp; William Shakespeare\u2019s play of the same name, which immortalised the St Crispin\u2019s day speech, invoking the memory of \u201cwe few, we happy few, we band of brothers\u201d which has resonated down the centuries.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Being an historical piece, we carefully examined the sword in April of 2016. The sword, shield and helmet is displayed in the dimly lit basement of the Westminster Abbey in London, England.&nbsp; While striving to respect the historical proportions of the sword, we also recognize the importance of making it a functional piece for modern demands of students of the sword. We proceeded to create a beautifully practical, yet sophisticated sword with an equally beautiful guard and pommel and peen-block.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Our vision for the Henry V sword, was to create a medieval weapon worthy of the aristocracy, by way of balance and performance, while keeping the decorative elements, as the original, to bare minimum. The perfect balance and swift response and agility of the sword would have to <em>make</em> this a royal medieval weapon of choice . &nbsp;Indeed Ewart Oakeshott described the sword as \u201cone of the most beautiful medieval swords to handle I have ever known.\u201d</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">While creativity was kept to a minimum, given the historical character, we nonetheless decided to elaborate on the guard by broadening the tear drop &nbsp;with center curved arches and hollow ground diamond blade. Like many arming swords during the Hundred Years\u2019 War (1337-1453), Henry V\u2019s sword was forged with clean minimalist lines repeated on the pommel, guard and blade, forming an artistic flow of coherent lines and symmetry. While not overly decorated, Henry V\u2019s sword was nonetheless one of the most beautiful examples of a <em>clean</em> arming sword which spoke volumes about its creator and wielder. As such, considerable attention was paid to the crisp deep diamond shape geometry of the blade as well as its\u2019 performance and balance. While not entirely a flat diamond blade,&nbsp; Henry V\u2019s sword at the Westminster Abbey, is by no means hollow ground. We therefore felt that a simple diamond blade would not do justice to the sword and proceeded in making a low hollow ground diamond blade, making the center defined and crisp, but not overly con caved. &nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Henry V (1386-1422) waged war during a period of transition, witnessing an increase in heavy armor. During the 15<sup>th</sup> century, as heavy armor became increasingly common, the arming sword became the medieval weapon of choice for both the mounted knight and foot soldier of considerable status. Shorter and stiff, the arming sword, classified as a type XVIII sword, was perfect for close quarter combat. It was light, well balanced and had a sharp tapper and stiff tip, specifically designed to puncture the newly advent of heavy armor. The diamond cross sectional blade gave the sword devastating stabbing force against plated armor and brigandines (leather vest lined with iron plates), while retaining its destructive cutting edge.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The type XVIII sword was composed of a straight-tapering blade, with an acutely-pointed profile and stiff diamond cross section capable of both thrust and cut. A remarkable example is held at the Wallace collection. Henry V\u2019s sword, as with all type XVIII arming swords, is a one handed sword. &nbsp;While mainly popular during the 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;C, arming swords such as the type XV, with a more flattened type diamond shape blade came into use during the later part of the 13<sup>th</sup> century.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The hollow ground diamond shape counterpart (Type XVIII) According to Ewart Oakeshott, began during the second quarter of the 15<sup>th</sup> century. \u201cthe four faces of the blade, instead of being flat or very gently hollowed, are so strongly hollowed out that a nearly flat blade with a powerful upstanding mid-rib&nbsp; results\u2026.surviving examples seem not to date earlier than 1425\u201d (Ewart Oakeshott, \u201cThe Sword in the Age of Chivalry\u201d p, 59).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">During this period, sword geometry evolved to balance thrusting with the cutting geometry of previous periods. It was during this period that blade geometry began morphing more quickly as a </span><img class=\"size-full wp-image-28334 alignright\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thumbnail_Arming-sword-wallace-collection.jpg\" alt=\"thumbnail_Arming-sword-wallace-collection\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">response to the technological advances of the full plate armor of the medieval knights.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">As such, we designed the sword with a deep hollow ground blade rather than a flat diamond cross sectional one. The blade is stiff and has a four-sided triangle-shape profile, with a diamond cross section, acute point and no fuller. Such blades were popular from the 15th century among the nobility for their resilience, light weight, dexterity and devastating thrusting capabilities. Due to these advantages, the type XVIII arming swords became the prevailing weapon of the 15th C.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Arming swords were exclusively owned by the elite aristocracy of the time. That said however, arming sword with flattened diamond blades were also used by the foot soldiers.

Until his untimely death from dysentery, he was recognized as a powerful warrior and brilliant military tactician \u2013 who fought as young as 14 and lead an army at 16. Despite the long list of achievements, <a title=\"Henry V Sword - \" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Henry V</a>&nbsp;is most remembered for his&nbsp;unparalleled military techniques displayed at the battle of Agincourt. Greatly outnumbered and starved, the English forced defeated the French almost entirely due to the young King\u2019s military strategy. The Henry V battle ready sword, labelled as a type XVIII.1 by Ewart Oakeshott, was apparently \" hung above the chantry of Henry V until it either fell, or was taken down and stawed away in an old chest\".&nbsp;When studying the&nbsp;Henry V medieval sword, Oakeshott&nbsp;described it as&nbsp;\"the very epitome of a fighting weapons\" and \"one of the most beautiful medieval swords to handle I have ever known.\"</span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Okeshott described the sword as being graceful, with an acute tip. \"the 2\" wide blade dawns a four-sided flattened diamond cross section, typically associated with type XVIII Medieval Swords. The extremely tapered blade points to its transitional role from a purely hacking and slashing weapon to one that had both cutting and thrusting capabilities. In the late 14th C., improvements in plate armor began to appear and a new type of sword was required to successfully counter these improvements. As a whole, the design of Henry V's sword, mostly due to its blade geometry, makes it as one of the most interesting swords to handle. Perfectly balanced, responsive, powerful yet light, the Henry V sword is considered as one of the best conceived swords of the late medieval period.&nbsp; In later writings, Oakeshott described it as \"..no mere funerary object, but as a magnificent fighting sword which comes to life in one's hand.\" Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

As the European longsword developed through the middle ages, it adapted to suit the needs of the wielders. Early in the Medieval period the classic knightly sword was more commonly of the \u201carming sword\u201d variety \u2013 single handed and double edged, meant to be wielded with a shield. As armor quality increased single handed swords as primary weapons became less effective, and were relegated to the position of sidearm. Longswords and two-handed sword became more prominent, being more effective against armored foes and more versatile in combat. An example of when these swords were commonly used would be by the nobility during the 100 years war between England and France (1337 to 1453).\n\nThe term \u201cbastard sword\u201d refers to any sword that can be used with equal effectiveness with either one hand or two; with one hand to pair with a shield or for extra reach, or with two hands for greater power and maneuverability. This particular reproduction by Darksword Armory is based on an original found in the Royal Armouries in Leeds, England. A fully battle ready type XIV blade tapers decisively from the hilt to along and graceful point, complimented by a deep fuller that travels roughly 2/3the length of the blade. The guard is gently sloped from the hilt, which is wrapped in leather. A classic wheel pommel, common to the type XIV, completes the sword.\n\nThe Medieval Knight blade, crafted with a sharp taper, was common during the medieval swords of the 14th C. These highly tapered blades were engineered to counter the ever increasing plate armors emerging during the start of the 14th C. To offset these defensive measures, swords with long, narrow, deeply tapered blades and reinforced thrusting tips were favored, not only by the German and Italian armies, but also by the English, and later the French. While keeping the traditional crucifix form, the Medieval knight bastard sword's guard curves slightly to block and parry incoming blows. &nbsp;The guard is individually crafted from mild steel and finely shaped with smooth, classically elegant octagonal lines.\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\nThe long hand-and-a-half handle allows the sword to be held in one or two handed fashion.&nbsp;While the base of the blade provides the strength to cut through opponents, the strong yet tapered tip allows for deadly thrusts, exceptional response and effective stabbing.\n\nHand crafted and properly engineered for durability in combat, the Medieval Knight Bastard sword is a very solid, responsive, and perfectly balanced weapon. The blade, hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel, is skillfully Dual Hardened for exceptional cuts while remaining flexible for enduring combat.\n\nAs with all our swords, the Medieval Knight Bastard Sword is a battle ready sword, &nbsp;and is among our staff's favorite medieval swords due to its clean lines, superb handling characteristics, and beautiful blade geometry. &nbsp;It is authentic in every detail and classically elegant.

The Normans (also called Northmen or Norsemen) were the descendants of the Scandinavian Vikings who raided the European coastal settlements at the outset of the 8th century. Under the leadership of Rollo, a Viking raider, the Norsemen established control over an area of what would one day be known as France. Their control over this area was so absolute that they were granted ownership by Frankish King Charles III, called Charles the Simple, in 911 CE. The Scandinavian Vikings who raided the European coastal settlements at the outset of the 8th century had become not only landed immigrants, but title-holding nobility.</span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Working on the Two Handed Norman Sword was a Challenging endeavor. Given the historical significance and popularity of Norman swords, we opted to recreate a Two handed version of the traditional single handed Norman swords depicted in the Bayeux tapestry. The Guard, being very symbolic, served not only as a cross for praying prior to battles and ceremonies, but also as a counter block in combat. The Guard, individually crafted from mild steel and finely shaped with smooth octagonal lines, is further accentuated by the decorated leather wrapped Oak handle. The two handed Norman sword is not only one of our best sellers, it is one of the top \"Staff picks\" in our collection. Hand crafted and properly engineered for durability in combat, the Two Handed Norman sword, is a very solid, responsive, and perfectly balanced weapon. The blade, hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel, is skillfully Dual Hardened for precise cutting while remaining flexible for enduring combat. In a nutshell, the Two handed Norman Sword is a finely crafted sword that is built to last!</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.\nDual Tempered HRc 60 48-50 at the core\nTotal length: 47.5\"\nBlade length: 36.5\"\nBlade Width : 2\"\nBlade Thickness: 2.02mm\nWeight: 4lbs 3oz\nPOB: 6.5\"",

Formed at the end of the <a href=\"https://www.umich.edu/~eng415/timeline/summaries/First_Crusade.htm\">First Crusade</a> as a group of knights \u2013 originally French \u2013 who took monastic vows, they swore to protect pilgrims travelling from Europe to the Holy Land. Their headquarters was in Jerusalem on the Temple Mount, which led to their name (which references the Temple of Solomon). While the Order began without wealth, living off donations from villagers, the <a href=\"http://www.theknightstemplar.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/knights-templar.jpg\">Templar Knights</a> emerged as an extremely wealthy and politically powerful organisation. One of the reasons for this was Pope Innocent II\u2019s 1139 proclamation that exempted the Order from local laws, which left them answerable to no government except the Pope himself. This catapulted them from an order of militaristic monks into a political force to be reckoned with.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Initially, the Knights Templar were a military order \u2013 and a wildly successful one, with stores of their mounted knights breaking much superior forces. However, as the Order expanded, they began branching out in new and innovative directions. The Order became an early form of bank, able to receive deposits, hold valuables and funds, and provide loans \u2013 with interest, previously forbidden to church organisations. This newfound ability became the Order\u2019s primary focus, and their activities changed to match. Many wealthy and powerful people found themselves in debt to a military order that was above the law in every sense of the word. One such individual was King Phillip IV of France, who was deeply indebted to the Order. King Phillip initiated the fall of the Order in 1307, arresting many Knights Templar and torturing them into admitted to heresy. Facing political pressure as a result of the scandal, Pope Clement ordered the Order dissolved in 1312. Many of their members were executed, their assets were seized and distributed to other orders of the Church, and the last Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, was burned at the stake in 1314. The greatest military force of the Crusader era was gone.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Despite this fall from grace, the Knights Templar have captured the imagination of modern sword collectors and history enthusiasts. Their weapons have been the subject of much interest, and while many of the original weapons were destroyed and or thrown into rivers following the dissolution of the Order, a handful of good examples survived. Numerous photographs of the original Two Handed Templar sword are published in \u201cThe Journal of Arms and Armour Society\u201d, (Oakeshott, E. \u201cA war sword of the XIVth Century in the Guildhall Museum\u201d). The sword of the crusaders and the Templar Knights, in their crucifix form, exemplifies the archetypical Sword of the middle ages.</span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The embellishing of the pommel, with its decorative cross, was common on Templar swords. As a medieval weapon, the Two handed Templar sword is an imposing, powerful yet elegant piece. Hefty, yet carefully balanced for optimum functionality, the sword is resilient, reliable and virtually indestructible. meticulously crafted with a 2.3'' wide blade,&nbsp;&nbsp;the Templar sword not only provides devastating cuts but can thrust through armor with unrivalled ease. &nbsp;In a nutshell, the Two handed Templar sword is a dependable sword that will last for generations.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photograph of the original sword, on display at the Museum of London, in England.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-22106 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1339-Two-Handed-templar-Sword.jpg\" alt=\"Antique-Museum-templar-sword\" width=\"711\" height=\"178\">\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Two Handed Templar Sword</h2>\n<strong>Customer Feedback:</strong>\n\n\"Both my swords arrived in good order.

A time when Vikings piled into long ships to set out across the seas, raiding and settling the lands they found. But far more than just savage barbarians, they were also farmers, poets, traders, and explorers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Their stories can be found in the <a href=\"https://naturalhistory.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/sagas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vinland Sagas</a>. Part of the <a href=\"http://www.sagadb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Icelandic Sagas</a>, and evoking the legendary names of Einar and Erik the Red, the Vinland Sagas represent the most complete information about the Norse exploration of the Americas and paint a vivid portrait of a heroic world long lost and the amazing people who inhabited it. The Vinland sagas originate from the same land as Njal and Gunnar, as told in Njal\u2019s Saga, two friends whose families\u2019 unending feud would bring them to a violent end. As the tragedy of Njal\u2019s family unfolds, Grettir the Strong\u2019s </span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">strength and temper transform him into a hero, an outlaw, and a villain. Across the sea in England, Egil Skallagrimson adds to his legend to become a warrior poet above all others. And, outlawed from his home in the wake of the feud, Erik the Red sails far to the west to discover new&nbsp;lands, founding the doomed settlement known as Vinland.</span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Einar, is inspired from the Vinland sagas and by Norse Mythology. Derived from the Old Norse name Einarr, which according to one of the foremost Scandanavian scholars, Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson, is connected with the concept of the einherjar, undead warriors from Norse mythology. The name, is related to the Old Norse common nouns einar\u00f0r (meaning \"bold\") and ein\u00f6r\u00f0 (meaning \"valour\").</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Most Viking swords fit within the Petersen Typology, described by Norwegian archaeologist Dr Jan Petersen. Petersen lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the result of his life\u2019s work as a system of classification for the Viking Sword. The Peterson Typology traces the development of the Viking Sword throughout history, from its origins in the Roman Spatha to its eventual transition into the Medieval knightly weapon. The Darksword Armory Einar Viking Sword is based on later examples in the Petersen Typology from the 10th and 11th centuries \u2013 most closely resembling the Type U with its decorative hilt and long, broad, wide-fullered blade terminating in a classic spatulate tip. The knotwork on the cast bronze hilt and the carved oak handle is inspired by actual knotwork on historical Norse artifacts, and is one of the most intricate Viking designs we\u2019ve ever attempted.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Viking swords were often status symbols, and as highly decorated as the Einar is one could assume its purpose to be decorative. Nothing could be further from the truth - hand-forged from 5160 high carbon steel and dual tempered, the Einar Viking Sword is a rugged weapon of choice. Its broad blade is resilient enough to perform the function that all Viking Swords were designed for \u2013 to cut through enemies, to split armor and shield, and to protect what the Viking warrior held dear. Despite its robust construction the Einar is surprisingly agile, able to move from cut to guard with smooth motions. In a practiced hand the Einar would be devastatingly effective on the battlefield.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Aggregating all essential elements of Viking art and Norse Mythology, the Einar exemplifies the peak of Viking culture.&nbsp;Luxuriously handcrafted from the finest material,&nbsp;the Einar is an distinguished viking sword you will be proud to own.

And in have now joined all the faithful in Valhalla. This is by far the most amazing sword I now own. It is everything I expected and more. The pictures do it justice, but until one holds it in their hand, they cannot imagine the feeling of now having joined the elite warriors of old who sought out new worlds and new conquests. Holding this sword brings me as close to that as one can ever be. I applaud you Eyal and all at DSA, this sword even surpasses my Wolfsbane. And that I thought impossible. Also thanks for the extra goodies. Keep up the too work.'\n<em>- A. Meeds, USA.</em>\n\n&nbsp;",

The climate was harsh, the seas untameable, the world around them filled with hostile cultures. Yet they set out to make their homes in inhospitable lands, conquer the forbidding seas, and be such a scourge of fear upon the surrounding area that even now the image of the Viking raider is embedded in cultures around the world. Is it any surprise, then, that such a people would conceive of an afterlife as brutal and as noble as the lives they led?<br >\n<br>\nValhalla \u2013 translated as \u201cThe Hall of the Fallen\u201d \u2013 was the hall of Odin Allfather, chief of the Norse gods. Within this hall he invited those Norse warriors who were bravest, fiercest, and strongest among all their kin to be his guests. This was not to be an afterlife of rest, though; for Odin gathers these warriors with a purpose. The great battle of Ragnar\u00f6k approaches, wherein J\u00f6rmungandr the World-Serpent and Fenrir the great wolf rise up to do battle with the gods, laying waste to creation in the process. To aid the gods in this battle Odin brings the greatest of the Norse warriors to Valhalla \u2013 to train and wait in readiness for the final day when they will fight at the sides of their gods.<br />\n<br>\nEntry into Valhalla was not a guarantee \u2013 only the best and bravest would be selected. For this reason, a Viking warrior would throw himself into the fray with berserker passion, attempting to fight with such skill and bravery that he would be worthy of Odin. When he died in battle, he could only hope that his deeds were great enough to attract the attention of the Allfather. Those who were worthy would be visited upon their deaths by the Choosers of the Fallen \u2013 the Valkyrie, female spirits of war and death. The Valkyrie were known as beautiful, and terrible, servants of Odin \u2013 the Sagas emphasize their ferocious natures, stating that to look upon them was akin to beholding a naked flame.<br /> \n<br>\nA Valkyrie\u2019s duty would be to take the spirit of a fallen warrior to Valhalla, where they would join the ranks of the undead spirits (this is likely also why in the Sagas Odin is once referred to as Draugadr\u00f3ttinn \u2013 \u201cLord of the Undead\u201d). Those worthy would become known as the Einherjer, a name that comes from two Norse words meaning \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cvalour,\u201d but has also been translated as \u201cone who fights alone.\u201d<br />\n<br>\nIn Valhalla, the Einherjer engaged in what would seem like paradise to a living Viking \u2013 they fought, in ceaseless combat all day. During this time they would increase their skills and perform many deeds of valour unknown to mortal men. As the sun set on the hall of Odin the Einherjer would stop fighting and turn to revelry. Their wounds would be healed while they eat their fill and drink endless flowing mead, only to start the cycle again at dawn. To become one of the Einherjer was the penultimate goal for any Viking warrior, and they literally give their lives to attain it. For those that still believe, the Einherjer wait in readiness still.<br />\n<br>\nThe Darksword Armory Einar sword was created with these warriors in mind \u2013 in fact, the name of the sword comes from the same Nordic root word as \u201cEinherjer.\u201d We wanted to design a Viking sword that would capture the dualistic nature of this culture \u2013 the graceful deadliness, the savage beauty. We also wanted to create something that would be worthy of the spirit of the Einherjer \u2013 of those peerless warriors who dedicated their lives and deaths to the sword. The process of designing this sword was a long one, but we feel proud at the result \u2013 which is one of the greatest swords we have ever produced. We humbly present it to you, and hope that it will have a special place in whatever halls you carry it.<br>\";s:14:\"_product_video\";s:0:\"\";s:19:\"_product_video_size\";s:0:\"\";s:24:\"_product_video_placement\";s:0:\"\";}}",

The two handed sword had begun as an instrument of war, but now it evolved.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Swordplay in 16th century Germany was a refined martial art, with at least two centuries of development by masters of swordsmanship such as Johannes Liechtenauer, Sigmund Ringeck, and Hans Talhoffer. The longsword was used for judicial duels, which could be armoured or unarmoured. These duels made frequent use of winding and binding, as each swordsman tried to manoeuvre the tip of their blade into position to strike at their opponent\u2019s head. All across Europe, knowledge of swordplay became a basic requirement for the Renaissance gentleman.</span></p>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">With the longsword being used more and more for duelling and by lightly armored infantry on the battlefield, the hilt began to evolve away from a simple cruciform shape. Finger rings, known as \u201cthe arms of the hilt\u201d, were added to protect the forefinger when it was looped around the guard for extra leverage. Side rings were attached to the guard to protect the ungauntleted hand during deflections, binding and winding. These refinements, along with a knuckle guard on single-handed blades, would give rise to the rapier hilt.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The 16th Century Two-Handed Sword is based by the original, displayed at the Wallace collection, in London(Wallace collection, A.479). Its elegant complex hilt features side rings and finger rings for additional hand protection, and it has a triple-fullered Oakeshott type XX blade with a long ricasso.

Films, television series, book series, and stage productions all exist of the tale, each giving their own interpretation of the story. And with good reason \u2013 if anything can be said to be a mythological history of England, it\u2019s the story of Arthur, the kingdom of Camelot, the Knights of the Round Table \u2013 and the mighty sword Excalibur.\n\nTales of Arthur have existed for centuries, though most modern visitors to our website will be familiar with a few of the more recent classics \u2013 The Once and Future King by T.H White, for most, which was published in 1958. What few people realize is that this book \u2013 and most of the modern retellings of the story \u2013 are actually based on a volume written over five centuries ago. Le Morte d\u2019Arthur (\u201cThe Death of Arthur\u201d) is a 15th-century Middle English epic written by Sir Thomas Malory, and gathers together various tales and folklore involving Arthur into a comprehensive and cohesive story. Le Morte d\u2019Arthur is the origin of all modern retellings of the tale, no matter how far from the source material they depart, and nowhere is this more clear than in the 1981 movie masterpiece \u2013 Excalibur.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-17286\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/excalibur-movie-sword-darksword-armory-350x197.jpg\" alt=\"excalibur-movie-sword-darksword-armory-350x197\" width=\"446\" height=\"251\">The 1981 film is directly based on the most recognizable portions of Sir Thomas Malory\u2019s collection, and is a modern classic. Picking up the story even before Arthur was born with the tyrant Uther Pendragon, the film covers the entirety of Arthur\u2019s life in tragic detail. The drawing of the titular sword from the stone, Arthur\u2019s rise to the throne, the betrayal of Lancelot and Guinevere, and Arthur\u2019s death at the hands of Mordred all play out under the artful direction of John Boorman. The film featured famous actors like Sir Patrick Stewart, launched the film careers of Gabriel Byrne and Liam Neeson, and was the breakout role for Helen Mirren, arguably one of the most talented (and definitely the most beautiful) women in Hollywood history. The true star of the film, though, was the sword at the center of it all.\n\nEven in a film with exquisite set design, costumes, and period armor (designed by Terry English), the prop Excalibur stands out. Every time it is on screen it steals the scene \u2013 shining bright like the sword of legend. When characters react to the sword with awe, the audience believes it. The film and the sword launched many young men and women into a lifetime of obsession with swords \u2013 us here at Darksword included. The original prop from the film resides in John Boorman\u2019s home in Ireland, but as fans of the film and as swordmakers ourselves, we felt compelled to make our own attempt to pay homage to the sword that so entranced us when we were young.\n\nIn the words of Darksword Armory founder Eyal Azerad:\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cAs a collector and bladesmith, the making of Excalibur sword was a deeply personal project. As for many, John Boorman\u2019s 1981 Epic Film was not only my favorite movie but, as a child, my introduction to the \u2018Middle Ages.\u2019 This introduction, crystalized \u2018The Excalibur\u2019 at the core of my passion and a romanticized vision of the \u2018Middle Ages.\u2019 Hence, forging the Excalibur sword, was a passion project for myself and the staff alike. We felt we owed this sword our utmost attention. Making yet another \u2018decorative\u2019 Excalibur was not an option. Our recreation had to be classically elegant, vibrant, and faithfully crafted from the original prop. Our goal was not only to produce a finely hand forged sword, but to replicate the lasting legacy of the film.\u201d</p>\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-40410\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Excalibur-king-arthur-sword.jpg\" alt=\"Excalibur King Arthur Sword \" width=\"396\" height=\"223\"></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Excalibur is a unique reproduction. A sturdy, double-edged blade suitable for cut and thrust techniques is balanced by a long handle and hefty pommel. The high polish brass guard and pommel is strikingly beautiful, making it sure to stand out in any collection.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Customer Feedback:</strong>\n\nI purchased one of your Excaliburs a few weeks ago, and it is a true work of art. It was worth every penny. The Darksword Armory staff deserves a pat on the back. for thier excellent workmanship, and attention to detail. I\u2019m extremely satisfied with it.

I have many swords in my collection...but right away i could tell just by handling this piece of art, that this was not any run of the mill, mass produced, machined cut sword...this far exceeds anything i have in my current collection &amp; at such a reasonable price, this has been accurately described...\"HAND FORGED\", this is now taking pride of place on my wall, thankyou very much for making my christmas &amp; the free gift of the stilletto dagger is an added bonus\n\n<em>~ Barry., H. - UK</em>\n\nHey Darksword ... I just received my Excalibur, #207, ... fabulous! I'm\nalmost afraid to touch it for fear the Lady of the Lake might ask for it\nback. :-O I had to wait a year to order and when it finally arrived I\ntook my sweet time unwrapping this beautiful piece of art and\ncraftsmanship. Beautiful scabbard... couldn't be\nhappier with it all. I'm going to smile every time I look at it or give\nit a few swings.

    "excerpt": "<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/excalibur-logo-1.jpg\" alt=\"excalibur-logo\">\n\nBased on one of the most recognizable props in movie history, the Excalibur exists at the intersection of beauty and function. A replica of the sword of King Arthur as depicted in the 1981 film Excalibur, this one handed sword is fully battle-ready. Brass hilt furniture and a wire-wrapped grip compliment the mirror-polished blade. A staff favorite, this is an authoritative, functional, and resilient sword. Skillfully crafted for the most demanding collector, the Excalibur is the benchmark of what a real sword should be.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-23088\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dsa-new-logo-1.jpg\" alt=\"dsa-new-logo\" width=\"84\" height=\"72\">\n\n5160 High Carbon Steel\nDual hardened\nTotal length: 41.5\"\nBlade length: 34\"\nGrip length: 6\"\nBlade width at base: 2\"\nWeight: 3 lbs 13 oz",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #333333;\">The Templars formed at the end of the First Crusade as a group of knights who took monastic vows. They swore to protect pilgrims travelling from Europe to the Holy Land. While the Order began without wealth, living off donations from villagers, the Templar Knights emerged as an extremely wealthy and politically powerful organisation. Threatened by their growing political power, Edward II dissolved the order in 1314, executed the Templars, and ordered the burning of the last Grand Master, Jacques de Molay.</span>\n<p style=\"font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #333333;\">While many of the original weapons were destroyed and or thrown into rivers following the orders of Edward II, a handful of good examples survived. Numerous photographs of the original Two Handed Templar sword are published in \u201cThe Journal of Arms and Armour Society\u201d, (Oakeshott, E. \u201cA war sword of the XIVth Century in the Guildhall Museum\u201d). The sword of the crusaders and the Templar Knights, in their crucifix form, exemplifies the archetypical Sword of the middle ages.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #333333; background: white;\">The embellishing of the pommel, with its decorative cross, was common on Templar swords. As a medieval weapon, the Two handed Templar sword is an imposing, powerful yet elegant piece. Hefty, yet carefully balanced for optimum functionality, the sword is resilient, reliable and virtually indestructible. meticulously crafted with a 2.3'' wide blade,&nbsp;&nbsp;the Templar sword not only provides devastating cuts but can thrust through armor with unrivalled ease. &nbsp;In a nutshell, the Two handed Templar sword is a dependable sword that will last for generations.</span> <span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #333333;\">We are confident that our Elite Series swords will impress even the most discriminating collector.</span>\n\nLimited Edition Elite Series Swords\n\nDarksword Armory\u2019s Elite Series swords are individually hand forged, following the strictest guidelines.

    "content": "\u201cIt can\u2019t be a Viking helmet, there\u2019s no horns on it!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLargely in part due to Renaissance artwork, opera costumes, and pop culture, there seems to be a wide misconception among the general public that Vikings commonly wore helms with giant horns. This has never been the case (as far as historical evidence can tell). While Vikings were a surprisingly artistic people, they were eminently practical as well. Horns on a helmet would be easily caught by weapons, turning the helmet askew and rendering it useless in protecting its wearer \u2013 and a Viking warrior would never allow that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne of our newer pieces of armor, the Darksword Armory Viking Helmet is made of heavy duty 14g steel. Strongly constructed by our trained smiths, it is rated for re-enactment combat. It has a soft leather lining to ensure comfort and to protect against the shock of hard blows. A flared nose guard protects the face and compliments the conical shape. This piece would fit any sword collection, or complete a Viking outfit for the Renn Faire handsomely.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJps4-IeBTo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "content": "In J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, the Nazgul were terrifying creatures that served the Dark Lord Sauron. Before they became creatures of evil, however, they were great kings of men who were given rings of power that slowly enslaved them \u2013 transforming them into Nazgul, the Ringwraiths. The Ringwraiths were depicted in the Peter Jackson movies as being humanoid, swathed in many layers of black fabric, and wearing cruel looking armor on their arms and legs. Darksword Armory has reproduced part of the armor here as the Fantasy Leg Armor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Fantasy Leg Armor is one of the most complex design we have created to date, and is made of 12 interlocking fully articulated parts. The leg armor is made of 16 g steel and fully functional for reenactment combat. Suspension and adjusting straps are fitted to the leg armor to allow for a wide range of sizing needs. These are fully articulate and allow full mobility, so you won\u2019t be restricted whether you are cosplaying at Comicon, reenacting, or just wearing them around the house (a totally acceptable choice).

To ancient cultures they represented a fearsome quality, an aspect of nature that was decidedly unfriendly towards humanity. Their intelligence must have seemed uncanny, even sinister \u2013 which is why in Viking culture they feature so prominently as creatures of evil. The great wolf Fenrir is the clearest example as a force of malevolence in the Viking world, prophesied to be the slayer of Odin Allfather.\n</br>\n</br>\nAccording to numerous surviving sources from the Viking era, Fenrir is one of the offspring of the trickster god Loki and the giantess Angrbo\u00f0a (along with the serpent J\u00f6rmungandr and goddess of death Hel). When Fenrir was still young the gods <img class=\"size-full wp-image-20698 alignright\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wolfsbane-sword-medieval-weapons-sketch-hilt.jpg\" alt=\"wolfsbane sword medieval weapons sketch hilt\" width=\"370\" height=\"249\">knew that he would cause much harm and attempted to trick him into being bound for all time. Twice the fashioned great iron bonds to hold him (purporting to be \u201ctesting his strength\u201d); however, Fenrir was too powerful, and the first two attempts failed. For their third attempt they asked the Svart\u00e1lfar (dwarves) to make them an unbreakable chain \u2013 Fenrir was by now suspicious, though, and refused to test this new chain without a show of good faith from the gods.\n</br>\n</br>\n\nAlone, of all the Norse pantheon, the god Try showed bravery, and placed his hand inside Fenrir\u2019s mouth. The dwarven bond held, and Fenrir was bound \u2013 though at the cost of the god Try\u2019s hand \u2013 and according to prophecy will remain so until the battle of Ragnarok when he will defeat Odin. Fenrir is also the father of the race of Wargs; fearsome giant wolves including Sk\u00f6ll and H\u00e1ti who are destined to join Fenrir during Ragnarok and devour the sun and the moon.\n</br>\n</br>\n\nWolves also feature prominently in the HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d though in an entirely different way. House Stark, one of the Great Houses of Westeros, holds dominion over a vast land known as the North and the Vale. Members of House Stark were once Kings over that land, though later became a part of a greater nation as Nobles. The symbol of House Stark is the fearsome Direwolf, a \u201cscaled up\u201d version of one of our Earth\u2019s wolves. Several members of House Stark (including the illegitimate child Jon Snow) actually take Direwolves as companions, some even bonding to them psychically. These Direwolves are fearsome yet noble creatures, acting in the best interests of the human they have become bonded to. Their relationship with House Stark is so important that when Jon Snow was given a sword of special Valyrian steel, the pommel of the sword was made into a wolf\u2019s head. This sword \u2013 \u201cLongclaw\u201d \u2013 is Jon Snow\u2019s signature weapon and as recognizable in our modern pop culture as any other sword in movies or on television.&nbsp;\n<img class=\" wp-image-20703 alignright\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"210\">\n</br>\n</br>\nWe at Darksword Armory are fans of Game of Thrones and Viking culture, and the Wolfsbane was born out of a deep appreciation for both. Blending a mix of Viking culture and a touch of House Stark, we wanted to create a sword reflecting the feel and theme of our favourite TV series, while preserving a sense of history. We set out to use both Norse elements and Game of thrones \u2018feel\u2019 to create a sword that was not only historically plausible, but also enriched with Viking mythology and a \u2018heroic\u2019 feel. to Achieve this, extensive research on viking art and scroll work was undertaken in written sources and museums. Using historical references, we designed the Wolfsbane's guard to reflect both Norse mythology, art and culture.&nbsp;The mythological symbol of the wolf is balanced by mirroring self-images on both pommel and guard. Expertly designed knotwork binds the wolf designs together.\n&nbsp;\n</br>\n</br>\n<img class=\"wp-image-20696 alignleft\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/9.jpg\" alt=\"lost wax process for wolfsbane sword guard \" width=\"327\" height=\"168\">Once designed, a prototype is engraved on a max master, and prepared for casting (shown left)\nusing the 'lost wax' process, also known <img class=\"wp-image-20726 alignright\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bronze-casting.jpg\" alt=\"bronze casting medieval weapons\" width=\"317\" height=\"156\">as&nbsp;investment casting, or precision casting. During this process, wax 'copies' of the guard and pommel is placed in a cylinder and covered in plaster. The plaster covers the entire surface of the fittings and molten bronze is then poured into the mold (plaster canister holding the wax fittings) as shown on the right. Once the mold is made, the wax guard is melted and drained away as the bronze pours into the mold, thereby melting the wax and taking the shape of the prototype in the plaster. Lost wax is also used in other applications such as statue making and sculpture reproduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</br>\n</br>\n\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Forging</span></h2>\nThe blades for the Wolfsbane swords are forged with 5160 High Carbon steel and&nbsp;differential hardened at a Rockwell of 60 at the Edge and 48-50 at the core. This gives flexibility to the blade, therefore making the swords more durable, while keeping the edge sharpness at an optimum<img class=\"wp-image-20728 alignright\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/forging-medieval-weapons.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"272\"> level. While forging, the blade is made by a 2 x 40 5160 flat bar and 'drawn' to the desired shape. While forging, we use heat to bring a 5160 flat bar to a malleable state in order to \"draw\" (hammer to shape) the blade of the sword.\n</br>\n</br>\nOnce the desired shape has been achieved, the steel is normalized; a process in which the&nbsp;blade is evenly heated and then allowed to cool gradually. The normalizing process removes any stress built up caused by heating and hammering of the blade. These \"stresses\" generally account for blade failure. Hence it is important to properly normalize a blade prior to Quenching and tempering a sword's blade. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n</br>\n</br>\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-20727 alignleft\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/forging-a-sword.jpg\" alt=\"medieval weapons forging \" width=\"426\" height=\"201\">While normalizing removes stress caused by the forging process, quenching (the rapid cooling of the blade) hardens the steel by changing its properties (from Pearlite to Martensite). The quenching affects the atomic structure of the steel by \"freezing\" the carbon that can freely migrate while the steel is hot. While quenching gives the blade better edge properties, it also makes the steel very brittle (too hard). To counter the brittleness and restore ductility and durability, the sword blade is then tempered; a heat treating process, used to increase the toughness of the blade. The purpose is to create a balance between toughness, hardness and flexibility.&nbsp;\n</br>\n</br>\n\n&nbsp;After cooling and polishing of the blade, the sword is assembled. The blade is fitted with the guard, pommel and grip. The point of balance <img class=\"wp-image-20700 alignright\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1.jpg\" alt=\"Wolfsbane Medieval weapon viking sword\" width=\"562\" height=\"366\">(POB) is carefully determined by the dynamics between the geometry and weight of he pommel and that of the blade. while the quality of the steel is essential to the medieval sword, the quench, tempering tang construction and geometry and POB are all precision aspects that combine the harmonic balance of the sword.&nbsp;\n\n</br>\n</br>\nWhile we at Darksword Armory attempt to give our all when we design each new sword, it is safe to say that the Wolfsbane holds a special place in our hearts. Meticulously crafted fittings and handle, the Norse Wolf, as a staple of Viking culture and mythology, is at the core of this Viking sword. At the same time, we intended it to evoke in fellow Game of Thrones fans a feeling of grandeur and adventure, as though they too stood with Jon Snow with the Night\u2019s Watch to defend Westeros. Finally, we hope that the spirit of the wolf \u2013 a creature that, while deadly, has come to represent ideals of family, nobility, and courage throughout human history and across many cultural boundaries \u2013 will go with this sword and protect you and your loved ones.\"\";s:14:\"_product_video\";s:0:\"\";s:19:\"_product_video_size\";s:0:\"\";s:24:\"_product_video_placement\";s:0:\"\";}}",

A 12<sup>th</sup> century stave church located in Norway, the Urnes Stave Church is renowned for its many examples of unique iconography including classic examples of Viking knotwork. While a site of Christian worship from the early 11<sup>th</sup> to the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, many of the thematic elements in the artwork are thought to be of old Norse origin. Certain knives in the Halstein Forge line belong to a special collection inspired by the Urnes Stave Church \u2013 knotwork on the handles has been taken from the designs in the church itself. We hope you will be inspired, as we were, to learn more about this special church and its rich history.</em>\n\nThe name L\u00f3egaire is an Irish Gaelic name of peculiar origin. Several prominent figures in Irish history bore the name, most notably several of Ireland\u2019s High Kings - L\u00f3egaire mac N\u00e9ill, for example, who was High King of Ireland during the time of St. Patrick and had two daughters who were converted to Christianity by the saint. What makes this so strange, though, is the figure from ancient Ireland who bore the name prior to those famous kings. Likely the most known historical figure with the name is L\u00f3egaire B\u00faadach, called L\u00f3egaire the Victorious, from the Ulster Cycle \u2013 a collection of traditional Irish tales and folklore. Unlike many other figures in the tale L\u00f3egaire B\u00faadach appears in the story as almost a comic relief figure \u2013 always seeming to come up short when it counts. The story of his death seems to fit with the character\u2019s down-on-his-luck idiom \u2013 while rushing to the aid of a condemned man, he strikes himself a mortal wound on the frame of a door. Still - L\u00f3egaire B\u00faadach manages to kill thirty men and rescue the condemned man before he succumbs, so perhaps it is not so ignoble an end after all.\n\nThe Halstein Forge L\u00f3egaire is the definitive Celtic dirk. The handle is carved with knotwork, inspired by Celtic designs as well as the artwork in the Urnes Staves Church. The oak handle is stained dark, which is common for knives from Celtic cultures. The double edged blade has a short, thick ricasso, and is made of our Damascus pattern-welded steel. L\u00f3egaire B\u00faadach and the Irish High Kings who came after him may not have carried this knife, but if they came across it they would surely recognize it as a worthy companion.\n\nFinely crafted Damascus steel Knives by skilled blade smiths, each knife is individually crafted, sculpted assembled and refined by a team of skilled knife makers.\n\nClassic elegance with stunning complexity, each knife presents its own character, geometry, and elegance, combining functionality with artistry, rending each unique collectible knife into a true work of art.\n\nA subdivision of world renowned sword makers, Darksword Armory inc., Halstein Forge individually hand crafts each knife in their shop located in Montreal, Canadian.\n\nThe Loegaire is forged with a&nbsp;blend of 1075 and 8670m steel, giving a stunning contrast to the folded steel layering.\n\nSpecs:\nTotal length: 13 3/4 inches\nGrip: 5 inches\nweight: 11.53 oz",

Nowhere is that more true than in Norse culture. For the Norse peoples, the position of chieftain (called \u201cJarl\u201d) was one that was both feared and respected. Jarls ruled their people, while not always gently or kindly, with iron resolve. Surviving information from the Viking era suggests that, for the Norse people, a Jarl was more than just a leader \u2013 he was father to his people, their provider and protector. The title and concept of the Jarl as wise and powerful chieftain has moved beyond the pages of history; from the History Channel\u2019s popular show \u201cVikings\u201d to the Nord nobility in the popular <em>Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</em> video game, the term Jarl has become a part of our popular culture.\n\nThe Halstein Forge Jarl knife is inspired by this traditional position of power. The blade itself is a simple traditional belt knife, as would be common for any Norse warrior to carry for tasks martial and mundane. However, the combination of the beautiful Damascus steel (which is historically plausible, as Viking smiths did discover the secrets of pattern-welding) and the oaken handle carved with Norse knotwork from the Urnes Stave Church makes this more than a simple tool. This knife is a beautiful piece of functional craftsmanship, worthy to be carried by a Jarl as he \u2013 or she \u2013 protects and guides their family.\n\nFinely crafted Damascus steel Knives by skilled blade smiths, each knife is individually crafted, sculpted assembled and refined by a team of skilled knife makers.\n\nClassic elegance with stunning complexity, each knife presents its own character, geometry, and elegance, combining functionality with artistry, rending each unique collectible knife into a true work of art.\n\nA subdivision of world renowned sword makers, Darksword Armory inc., Halstein Forge individually hand crafts each knife in their shop located in Montreal, Canadian.\n\nThe Jarl, meaning Chieftain, is forged with&nbsp;blend of blend of 1075 and 8670m steel, giving a stunning contrast to the folded steel layering.\n\nSpecs:\nTotal length: 13.3 inches\nGrip: 5.3 inches\nweight: 6.55 oz",

Especially when keeping weight down \u2013 having several pounds of steel that you may or may not use in your pack is a recipe for fatigue. This is why one typically only carries the knife that one is likely to use \u2013 a skinning knife when hunting, a survival knife when expecting short excursions only, a tactical knife when hand-to-hand combat is a likely reality. When the future is uncertain or the tasks to come especially varied, though, then it is practical to prepare for the unexpected \u2013 and for this, a bushcraft knife is essential. Unlike a survival knife (which is typically meant for emergencies), a bushcraft knife is meant to be a long-term use, multi-task knife. It will be sturdy, capable, and versatile enough to accomplish a myriad of outdoor tasks.\n\nThe Halstein Forge Bjarke is a such a bushcraft knife. The single edged, drop-point blade is sturdy and well tempered, which is absolutely essential for this type of knife. After all, it must be able to stand up to the rigors of extended use away from civilization. The blade is matched by a thick tang that meets the same standards for solid construction. The handle is comprised of two shaped slabs of oak, carved with knotwork inspired by the Urnes Staves Church. The Bjarke\u2019s Damascus steel blade may be beautiful, but this knife is quite the workhorse. It would be ideal as a personal belt knife for all you bushcraft needs, or as an every day carry (EDC) knife to assist in whatever situation you find yourself in..\n\nFinely crafted Damascus steel Knives by skilled blade smiths, each knife is individually crafted, sculpted assembled and refined by a team of skilled knife makers.\n\nClassic elegance with stunning complexity, each knife presents its own character, geometry, and elegance, combining functionality with artistry, rending each unique collectible knife into a true work of art.\n\nA subdivision of world renowned sword makers, Darksword Armory inc., Halstein Forge individually hand crafts each knife in their shop located in Montreal, Canadian.\n\nThe Bjarke is forged with&nbsp;blend of blend of 1075 and 8670m steel, giving a stunning contrast to the folded steel layering.\n\nSpecs:\nTotal length: 9 inches\nGrip: 4 inches\nweight: 10.47 oz",

They, like other early weapons such as axes and spears, are tools, and have been so almost since the beginning of humanity. That they are so often pressed into service against one\u2019s fellow human being does not change their essential nature; it simply reflects the state of human nature. Basic knives and basic spearpoints as essentially the same kind of tool; a short, double-edged blade, slightly raised center ridge, tapering to a point \u2013 essentially, a tool designed for cutting, slashing, or thrusting. Basic \u201cspearpoint\u201d knives have been around so long that their predecessors were shipped out of stone or volcanic glass \u2013 their descendants having changed more in material than in form or function.\n\nThe Halstein Forge Herleifr knife is a balance of simplicity and complexity. The straightforward spearpoint blade is wide and flat, with only the hint of a raised center. The handle is straight and long enough to balance the blade, with nothing in the way of complex hilt furniture. However, that is where the simplicity ends. The blade itself is a beautiful Damascus pattern, etched with old Norse runes. And the handle is carved with Norse knotwork, inspired by the similar markings in the Urnes Staves Church. While the basic knife hasn\u2019t changed much in thousands of years, here at Halstein Forge we have tried to give it a suitable update \u2013 and the Herleifr is a great example.\n\nFinely crafted Damascus steel Knives by skilled blade smiths, each knife is individually crafted, sculpted assembled and refined by a team of skilled knife makers.\n\nClassic elegance with stunning complexity, each knife presents its own character, geometry, and elegance, combining functionality with artistry, rending each unique collectible knife into a true work of art.\n\nA subdivision of world renowned sword makers, Darksword Armory inc., Halstein Forge individually hand crafts each knife in their shop located in Montreal, Canadian.\n\nThe Herleifr, meaning \"Warrior's descendant\", is forged with&nbsp;blend of blend of 1075 and 8670m steel, giving a stunning contrast to the folded steel layering.\n\nSpecs:\nTotal length: 9.5 inches\nGrip: 4.7 inches\nweight: 4.65 oz",

Tolkien's writings. Tolkien's Elves are powerful beings, whose grace, beauty and skill are all too often overshadowed by their hubris. The Elves fight against the Dark Lord for a millennium, sometimes winning decisive battles, other times bring brought to the brink of extinction. Only their strength that burns in their hearts seems to help them carry the day; their strength and the weapons of power that they create.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>The Sage fantasy&nbsp; elite series medieval sword was crafted with Tolkien's realm in mind. Middle Earth and the battles waged for the safety and respect of all living being. This philosophy was maintained during the creation of this battle ready sword. The smooth and subtle curves of the blade, guard and pommel were meant as a reflection of wisdom and understanding while the downward looping guard flows towards the curves of the blade in a form of dance between both parts. Despite this seemingly fragile aestheticism, this medieval fantasy sword is nothing but stern. It's 2\" wide blade delivers destructive cutting blows with a very sharp tip, leading to equally devastating thrusts. The Sage fantasy sword is not only an eye catcher, it is also a definite force on the battle field.\n\nLimited Edition Elite Series Swords\n\nDarksword Armory\u2019s Elite Series swords are individually hand forged, following the strictest guidelines. The Damascus steel blades, guards and pommels are made with a blend of 1095, 5160, L-6 and O1 steel, giving a stunning contrast to the folded steel layering.\n\nDarksword Armoy Elite models are limited to 100 swords worldwide ! Once sold, we will not be making other examples of the same model. Each sword comes with a scabbard, interlaced sword belt and an Elite Series numbered certificate stamped with the \u201cDarksword Elite\u201d Wax seal. Each certificate is individually signed by Eyal Azerad, owning founder of Darksword Armory Inc.\n\nWe are confident that our Elite Series swords will impress even the most discriminating collector.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDelay note: If we do not have your Elite Series Piece in stock. Please expect a wait time of approximately 6-12 months.\n\n&nbsp;",

Mention the swords of Scotland and people tend to mentally picture the Claymore, bring Viking swords up in conversation and everyone knows what you mean. So too with the swords of China and Japan, and even England has Excalibur. Bring up swords from Germany\u2019s history, though, and most people would draw a blank. Which is unfortunate, as Germany\u2019s history of arms and armor contains some truly unique and distinctive examples.\n\nThe development of the sword in Europe was far from a linear process. Certainly, the Roman Gladius led to the Roman Spatha, which led to the Viking double-edged sword, which led to the knightly swords depicted in Oakeshott\u2019s typology. This is generally accepted as the evolutionary chain of the European sword. However, this ignores a parallel development in Europe at the time, most notably occurring in the 13th century and onward, of single-edged weapons.\n\nPossibly descending from the Viking seax or through eastern influences such as Turkey/the Mongols (or both), several different varieties of single-edged swords began cropping up in different locations throughout Europe. The falchion is one such example, depicted in medieval art as well as (rare) surviving examples from this period. Design of the falchion could vary; some were clearly chopping weapons, yet others were lighter and more agile than the double-edged swords of the day. What is clear is that they were typically reserved for soldiers of less noble birth, and have earned a reputation as \u201cpeasant swords\u201d \u2013 though some decorated versions and depictions in art indicate this was not always the case. A separate typology (the Elmslie Typology) exists to classify these weapons.\n\nIn Germany, single edged weapons were also the province of the plebeians. The Bauernwehr (\u201cfarmer\u2019s knife\u201d), a mid-length, single-edged blade, was a common sidearm of the lower classes, used for both everyday tasks as well as combat. Later, more middle-class citizens would use the Lange Messer (\u201clong knife,\u201d aka Grosse Messer or \u201cgreat knife\u201d) as a weapon for personal defense. This greatly resembled the Bauernwehr but was too long for practical daily tasks; it was exclusively a melee weapon. This design was further adapted into the 15th century as the Kriegsmesser, or \u201cwar knife,\u201d and it is here that this German design truly comes into its own.\n\nThe Kriegsmesser is a formidable weapon, and rose to prominence during use by the Landsknechte. The Landsknechte were a mercenary force founded in the late 15th century by Archduke Maximilian I von Habsburg, a military commander and son of the Holy Roman Emperor Fredrick III. Maximilian founded the Landsknechte, had them trained in Swiss military tactics (generally seen as a superior form of fighting in that era), and forged them into a force to be reckoned with for decades afterward. The Landsknechte would be hired to win many victories for later Emperor Maximilian, and until their decline in the mid-to-late 16th century were one of the most feared opponents on any battlefield in Europe.\n\nThe Darksword Armory Knochenbrecher is based on the type of Kriegsmesser that would have been used by the Landsknechte. The long, single-edged blade is crafted from 5160 steel, and flares towards the tip in order to bring the balance out and create power in each cut. While the wide\n\nblade is relatively simple design, our approach to the sword gives it a touch of class with the shell guard and slightly curved quillions. The grip, clearly showing a visible tang, is long and suited for two handed use. All of these factors make this Kriegsmesser a very powerful medieval weapon, capable of destroying any target it encounters.\n\nThe Knochenbrecher is a massive sword, specifically made to inspire fear in the hearts of enemies. If you are worthy of joining the brave Landsknechte, please consider bringing this with you.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-50486 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/German-Messer-Medieval-Sword-1327.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1298\" height=\"1306\">\n\n&nbsp;",
    "excerpt": "<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Knochenbrecher-5.png\">\n\nWeapons of war often evolved from tools used for hunting, farming, or day-to-day survival in a hostile world, and nowhere is that more clear than in the German \u201cMesser\u201d (meaning \u201cknife\u201d) style of swords. Messer swords began as simple, single-edged weapons, merely scaled up versions of the knives from which they descended. Over time, they became distinctive, deadly, and beautiful weapons associated with the Germanic peoples. Darksword Armory\u2019s Knochenbrecher (German for \u201cBone Breaker\u201d) is based on the Kriegsmesser, meaning \u201cwar knife,\u201d the large and imposing weapon of the 15th-century. Large, brutal, and totally battle-ready, the Darksword Armory Knochenbrecher is a powerful cutter \u2013 balanced for delivering sweeping, heavy strikes as its historical counterpart would have been.\n\nMore information on the Knochenbrecher Sword and the history of the world in which it originated can be found below.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-53943\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Warranty-Banner-434x800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"222\" height=\"409\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.\nDual Tempered HRc 6048-50 at the core\nFittings : Mild Steel\nTotal Length: 45.5\"\nBlade Length : 34\"\nGrip Length: 11\"\nWeight: 3 lbs 8 oz.",

In pagan times, men swore by the elements, by the sun and the moon, by their crops, or by spiritual beings; after Christianity came to Ireland, they swore their oaths by relics, crucifixes, or even on the Bible itself. In some cases, they would travel to the grave of a loved one and make their oath upon it. Vows that individuals made were considered religious and legal obligations, and severe consequences could be brought upon any who broke their word. The most serious form that an oath could take in ancient Ireland, though, was the mythical <em>Geas</em>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">A Geas (pronounced \u201cgaysh,\u201d plural form \u201cGeasa), was a special oath often undertaken by Irish hero-warriors. More than a simple promise, a Geas was a bond of magical means, often involving a taboo or prohibition of some kind, and undertaken either at birth (when placed on the infant by a druid) or at the warrior\u2019s own agreement later in life. The function of the Geas was to preserve a warrior\u2019s honor, but occasionally could result in his downfall \u2013 especially when that warrior was under the effects of multiple Geasa. For example, the legendary hero C\u00fa C\u00fachullain (wielder of the shining sword Cruaid\u00edn Catutchenn) swore a Geas to never eat the flesh of a dog as he acted in the stead of his lord\u2019s guard dog. C\u00fachullain also swore a Geas to never refuse the hospitality of a woman, and found himself in a conundrum when an old woman served him dog meat in her home. Violation of a Geas results in misfortune or death, as it did for C\u00fachullain \u2013 unable to take action without violating his oath, he was forced to break the terms of his Geas. This led to his death at the hands of Lugaid mac Con Ro\u00ed as described in the Ulster Cycle. Irish stories frequently depicted heroes struggling with the multiple Geasa they labor under, striving to maintain their honor and avoid the consequences of breaking their word. In other words, this was an oath that an Irish hero could seek to fulfill for the rest of his days, with success never guaranteed.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The Darksword Armory Oath Seeker is inspired by those heroes of ancient Ireland and the Geasa they swore. The blade of the Oath Seeker is narrow, straight, and deeply hollow ground with a stiff spine, providing a balance between excellent handling and strength. The curved guard has graceful lines, complimenting the handle wrapped in forest green leather. The most distinctive feature of the sword is its pommel, which is known as a Irish ring hilt. The open ring pommels are a classic Irish design, and many surviving examples exist in the National Museum or Ireland as well as countless private collections. The Oath Seeker is our homage to the heroes of Ireland. While we don\u2019t recommend taking a Geas in this day and age, if you do please consider bringing the Oath Seeker with you.</span></p>\n&nbsp;",

Trouv\u00e9e au sein du Medieval Crime Museum ( Mittelalterliches Kriminalmuseum), en Allemagne.\n\nL\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e du Bourreau \u00e9tait le symbole et un \u00ab&nbsp;m\u00e9diateur&nbsp;\u00bb de la loi judiciaire. Beaucoup de courts de jugements exposaient des \u00e9p\u00e9es de bourreaux aux murs. Leur but n\u2019\u00e9tait pas seulement symbolique, puisque elle servait un but concret, celui de d\u00e9capiter les condamn\u00e9s. Les \u00e9p\u00e9es de bourreaux portaient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des gravures d\u2019images assez visuelles, telles que des tortures ou des sentences.\n\nCes \u00e9p\u00e9es \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement larges, les lames plates se terminaient non pas d\u2019une pointe mais d\u2019une face plate. La lame est grandement d\u00e9cor\u00e9e comme le serait n\u2019importe quelle \u00e9p\u00e9e de bourreau&nbsp;; Dans certains cas, le nom du bourreau y apparaissait, sur celle-ci y figure une inscription voulant dire \u00ab&nbsp;Je n\u2019\u00e9pargne personne&nbsp;\u00bb - Un message brutal pour les criminels faisants face \u00e0 l\u2019&nbsp;\u00e9p\u00e9e de bourreau.\n\nHistoriquement, les \u00e9p\u00e9es de la Renaissance ainsi que du M\u00e9di\u00e9val \u00e9taient des armes con\u00e7ues dans le combat rapproch\u00e9. Les c\u00f4t\u00e9s, la pointe ainsi que la garde \u00e9taient con\u00e7us afin de maximiser la versatilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e et ainsi son potentiel de dommage sur l\u2019homme. C\u2019est d\u2019autant plus vrai avec la capacit\u00e9 de p\u00e9n\u00e9tration des \u00e9p\u00e9es m\u00e9di\u00e9vales au cr\u00e9puscule de la p\u00e9riode m\u00e9di\u00e9vale. L\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e de bourreau cependant, n\u2019avait qu\u2019un seul but, d\u00e9capiter ses victimes. C\u2019est pour cela que l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9, contrairement aux \u00e9p\u00e9es militaires, \u00e9tait arrondie.

It may be surprising for people in modern times, though, to learn that the Normans were once called the Northmen or Norsemen \u2013 and were descendants of the Scandinavian raiders known as \u201cVikings.\u201d Under the leadership of Rollo, a Viking raider, the Norsemen established control over an area of what would one day be known as France. Their control over this area was so absolute that they were granted ownership by Frankish King Charles III, called Charles the Simple, in 911 CE. The Scandinavian Vikings who raided the European coastal settlements at the outset of the 8th century had become not only landed immigrants, but title-holding nobility. <br>\n<br>\nThe Norsemen adapted to their new circumstances, and quickly, as Rollo himself converted to Christianity at the urging of his Frankish hosts with his people soon following. The Norsemen \u2013 now firmly established as the duchy of Normandy \u2013 began advancing at an incredible rate. Art, architecture, music, politics \u2013 no area of Frankish culture was untouched by their influence. Normans became known as paragons of Christian virtue and Medieval nobility, Even the local language was changed, becoming known as Norman French. Despite the Normans\u2019 conversion to Christianity and their adoption of Frankish way of life, though, the Normans retained many of the traits of their Germanic ancestors \u2013 including skill in battle and tactics.<br>\n<br>\nWhile many areas of Europe were invaded, conquered, or aggressively settled by the Normans (including the establishment of the Kingdom of Sicily), there is no more famous military venture than the 11-th Century Norman conquest of England. William the Conqueror, a Norman Duke, was a distant relative of Anglo-Saxon King Edward the Confessor. Upon Edward\u2019s death in 1066, William led a train of cavalry, archers, and foot soldiers in an invasion of the British Ilse. They soundly defeated the gathered Anglo-Saxon army during many famous encounters such as the Battle of Hastings. William spent the next six years establishing his reign in Britain through granting of land and title to the Norman nobility who accompanied him and the construction of castles throughout the land. The influx of Norman culture into the Anglo-Saxon regions caused vast changes in the lives of both groups, and still influences the inhabitants of modern Britain today. <br>\n<br>\nThe Two handed Norman Sword, is an excellent example of the quintessential medieval sword. Known for its crucifix form, it is a classic design that has both many surviving replicas and depictions in period artwork. This design was famously presented in the Bayeux Tapestry: an embroidery that depicts the Norman Conquest. The Norman Sword, classified as type XI with elements of type XIIa, is elegant in its simplicity.\nWorking on the Two Handed Norman Sword was a Challenging endeavor. Given the historical significance and popularity of Norman swords, the artists at Darksword Armory opted to recreate a Two handed version of the traditional single handed Norman swords depicted in the Bayeux tapestry. The Guard, being very symbolic, served not only as a cross for praying prior to battles and ceremonies, but also as a counter block in combat. The Guard, individually crafted from mild steel and finely shaped with smooth octagonal lines, is further accentuated by the decorated leather wrapped Oak handle.<br>\n<br>\nThe two handed Norman sword is not only one of Darksword\u2019s best sellers, it is one of the top \u201cStaff picks\u201d in their collection. Hand crafted and properly engineered for durability in combat, the Two Handed Norman sword, is a very solid, responsive, and perfectly balanced weapon. The blade, hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel, is skillfully Dual Hardened for precise cutting while remaining flexible for enduring combat. \n\";s:14:\"_product_video\";s:0:\"\";s:19:\"_product_video_size\";s:0:\"\";}}",

It would be a suitable companion for any Ranger, especially for times when a silent knife is needed to deal with an orc patrol that wanders too close.\n\nCompanion dagger to the Ranger sword, &nbsp;the Ranger dagger is made of <a href=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapons/elite-series-damascus-steel-swords/\">Damascus steel</a> with a blend of 1095, 5160, L-6 and O1 steel, giving a stunning contrast to the folded steel layering. The handle is made of wood covered in black leather. Polished blade and pommel. The dagger comes with a scabbard and a strapping system to attach the dagger to the companion sword's scabbard.\n\n</div>\nDelay note: If we do not have your Elite Series Piece in stock.

A culture that elevated war to both an art and a form of religious expression, it is no surprise that the weapons they carried would be adorned with intricate and sacred designs. The Darksword Armory Einar is an example of the heights to which this art form could attain, and this \u2013 its companion dagger \u2013 shows similar artistic reach.\n\nThe Einar Dagger has a short 5160 spring steel blade, like all DSA products, fully battle ready \u2013 but like <a href=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapons/medieval-daggers/\">all daggers</a> would also be suitable for everyday or camp duties. The bronze fittings and carved oak handle are identical to its full sized counterpart, making it an ideal piece to match the <a href=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapon/medieval-swords/viking-sword-the-einar-1338/\">Einar sword</a>. The scabbard has a belt loop, and it will sit comfortably on the integrated sword belt available for the Einar. This is one of our best and most popular designs \u2013 we hope you like it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

What we now know about Vikings is that they were big believers in cleanliness and beauty, often spending time and valuables on their appearance. Nowhere is this made more clear than in their jewelry \u2013 for a culture of warriors, they had some downright fancy accessories. The Eira Viking Ring is an excellent example of this \u2013 not only does it depict the swirling knotwork so often associated with Norse artwork, but it is inlaid with gold to catch the eye and add to its beauty. The Eira Ring is our most beautiful Viking ring, and we hope you agree.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTungsten Carbide Comfort fit Viking Ring with gold inlay\n\nGenuine solid Tungsten Carbide (COBALT-FREE)\nBrushed with laser, comfort fit\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTwo times stiffer than steel, Tungsten Carbide is ranked second hardest next to diamond on the Mohs scale.\n\nIts toughness and&nbsp;extreme hardness makes it perfect for heavy wear, never losing&nbsp;its shape and remaining scratch free.\n\nHighly durable to oxydation and discoloration, its brightness will not fade over time.\n\nAll of our Tungsten rings are Cobalt Free and hypoallergenic.

In the Druidic faith of the Celtic people there was an intrinsic understanding of the interconnectedness of nature and spirituality. There was also an acknowledgement of balance between the sacred and the ordinary - many of their symbols reflected these beliefs, and none more than the Tree of Life. A symbol seen in many classic works of Celtic art, the stylized branches and roots weave together in an endless ring, connecting heaven and earth. The eye catching knotwork is expertly woven and surrounds and protects the trunk from which both branches and roots spring. No other symbol better represents one of the foundational principals of pagan beliefs - As above, so below.\n\n<span lang=\"EN-CA\">Trees and nature were essential to the Celtic belief system and culture. For the Celts, the Tree of life represented the force of nature, harmony and balance. An extension to this belief is how an individual tree come together to for a forest. The Celts believed that Trees link together, combining their life forces to provide a home for countless species, from small plants and insects to wild animals of all sizes. All cycles of life exists in balance, from birth through death.</span>\n\n<span lang=\"EN-CA\">Made of 316L Stainless steel, the Celtic pendant represents this belief and the combination of nature and all living beings.</span>",

While Gothic plate armor was functional, it eventually became less regularly used in battle and more regularly seen on parade \u2013 hence the emphasis in many Gothic styled armor on intricate designs and accents.\n\nIn melee combat, a warrior lives by the strength of their arm. When you swing your weapon you make yourself vulnerable to counterattack, and your arms would be natural targets for an enemy\u2019s blade. These full Gothic Arms are inspired by a 15<sup>th</sup> century model, and are constructed of high carbon steel. One part of a full suit of armor, they offer exceptional protection and articulation and provide a surprising range of motion to the wearer. The length of the arms is fully adjustable with a strapping system, and the pauldrons can be attached to a mail shirt, gambeson, armor, padded armor, or gorget. The Gothic Arms are made in house by Darksword smiths to our exacting standards.",

The rise of towns and cities across Europe created the infrastructure required to produce blades in greater quality and numbers. No longer affordable only by the nobility, the sword became an infantry weapon, provided by the quartermaster and used by the common soldier on the battlefield.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-28264 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/1970/01/thumbnail_sovereign-arming-sword-prototype-225x800.jpg\" alt=\"sovereign-arming-sword-prototype\" width=\"225\" height=\"800\">Likewise, advances in armouring technology created a new battlefield where adaptability mattered at least as much as striking power. With the sword now used by both mounted knight and foot soldier, the blade had to be able to pierce the plate armour of the knight as well as a strike against the variety of armor used by the infantry. The blade evolved to have a strong, reinforced tip for thrusting while retaining an edge built for cutting. Known as a cut-and-thrust sword, this flexibility was often the difference between life and death in the heat of combat, regardless of if its bearer was an infantryman or a mounted knight.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Co-designed by Darksword Armory and American bladesmith Bruce Brookhart. Taking inspiration from both Medieval French and German Swords, the Renaissance is a late 15th-century style arming sword with an Oakeshott type XVIII blade. The guard is decorated with a floral French motif while the 'Writhen' pommel is cast directly from a 15th century Katzbalger in the collection of the Renaissance co-designer, Eyal Azerad.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Hand forged, the Renaissance\u2019s blade is made from 5160 steel and deferentially heat treated to a Rockwell of 53 at the core and 60 at the cutting edge, giving this medieval sword astounding toughness and flexibility. The Guard and pommel are solid Bronze, crowned with a slightly diamond shaped Oak grip. Light, agile, durable, and sturdy, this is an arming sword that any Medieval soldier would have been proud to call his own.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Bruce Brookhart is an American bladesmith and weapon designer. Bruce worked closely with Hank Reinhardt for over 15 years and consulted Ewart Oakeshott for over a decade.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The sovereign is one of those swords that the entire staff was excited to work on. While using an historical example of the arming sword blade, Eyal, owner of Darksword Armory, worked closely with our designer, Terry, to create a beautifully clean, yet sophisticated sword with an equally beautiful guard and scent stopper pommel.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Our vision for this arming sword, was to create a medieval weapon worthy of the aristocratic echelon of society.&nbsp; We wanted to create a smooth or clean design while injecting the fittings with elegant details, prevalent during the 14<sup>th</sup> to the 16<sup>th</sup> centuries. &nbsp;While great importance was bequeathed to the elegance and the symmetry of the fittings, close attention was set on the blade\u2019s performance and balance. We felt that a simple diamond blade would not do justice to the vision we had for the Sovereign.&nbsp; We decided that a deep hollow ground diamond blade had to be fitted on this sword.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">During the 15<sup>th</sup> century, the arming sword became the primary medieval weapon of the aristocracy. As armor became increasingly layered, the arming sword because<img class=\"alignright wp-image-28220 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/1970/01/arming-swords-leeds-royal-armory-museum-black-prince-sword-470x800.jpg\" alt=\"arming-swords-leeds-royal-armory-museum-black-prince-sword\" width=\"470\" height=\"800\"> the medieval weapon of choice for both the mounted knight as well as the foot soldier of considerable status. Shorter than longswords, the Arming sword was perfect for the onslaught of close quarter combat. It was light, well balanced and had a sharp tapper and stiff tip, specifically designed to puncture heavy armor. The Arming sword proved to be a devastating weapon again the heavy plated armor of the time. The heavily tapered blade gave the sword devastating stabbing force against plated armor, while retaining it\u2019s destructive cutting edge. The sword came to be known as the \u2018Arming swords\u2019 because it became the weapon of choice for English, French and German forces.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">We examined numerous type XV swords during our visits to the British museum in London and the Royal armouries, in Leeds. All examples presenting similarities in regards to blade type, varying from flat diamond shape (such as the example in the Wallace collection inventory 22A), to hollow ground diamond blades in the Royal Armoury Museum in Leeds.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Classified as a type XV by Ewart Okeshott the Sovereign arming sword is a one handed medieval weapon. While mainly popular during the 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;C, some sources suggest that type XV swords made their appearance as early as the latter part of the 13<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. These arming swords however, were made with flattened diamond blades rather than hollow ground. According to Ewart Oakeshott, the heavily grounded diamond cross sectional blades of the arming swords began during the second quarter of the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-28221 size-full\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/1970/01/sovereign-sword-fittings-guard-pommel-casting-development-darksowrd-armory.jpg\" alt=\"sovereign-sword-fittings-guard-pommel-casting-development-darksowrd-armory\" width=\"573\" height=\"163\">The Sovereign\u2019s perfect balance combined with deadly cutting and thrusting capabilities make it a perfect sword for both beginner and advanced students of the sword. Being perfectly balanced and relatively short, the Sovereign sword has become a favorite among beginners \u2018of the sword\u2019 seeking to perfect their form.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The thick spine of the blade provides good stiffness. This makes the Sovereign sword manageable and powerful, with excellent thrusting ability.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Being an arming sword with superb balance, this one handed medieval weapon gives little resistance. It handles very well with one hand use, permitting the use of a shield, for students of mode I-33, on the opposite hand.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Sovereign sword has a very deep tapering, giving the sword an excellent piercing ability against chain mail and plate armor. The deadly thrusting tip can penetrate 18g armor, but is mainly used to thrust through opening under the armpits, gorgets, pauldrons, and other openings in the armor</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">While primarily a thrusting weapon, the stiff blade of the arming sword makes it an excellent cutter against any appropriate target. The sword\u2019s stiff blade and sharp edge will penetrate or cut through most targets with little effort.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Sovereign Arming sword is not only a beautiful medieval sword, it is truly an exceptionally well balanced medieval weapon. Easily wieldable and very responsive, it provides both novice and experienced users a very good performing battle ready weapon which will easily cut and thrust through most targets set against it.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">\u201cthe four faces of the blade, instead of being flat or very gently hollowed, are so strongly hollowed out that a newaly flad blade with a powerful upstanding mid-rib&nbsp; results\u2026.surviving examples seem not to date earlier than 1425\u201d (Ewart Oakeshott, \u201cThe Sword in the Age of Chivalry\u201d p, 59). During this period, sword geometry evolved to balance thrusting with the cutting geometry of previous periods. It was during this period that blade geometry began morphing more quickly as a response to the technological advances of the full plate armor of the medieval knights.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-28219 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/1970/01/sovereign-sword-unassembled-tang-grip-guard-pommel-medieval-weapon-darksword-armory-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"sovereign-sword-unassembled-tang-grip-guard-pommel-medieval-weapon-darksword-armory\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\">As such, we designed the sword with a deep hollow ground blade rather than a flat diamond cross sectional one. The blade is stiff and has a four-sided triangle-shape profile, with a diamond cross section, acute point and no fuller. Such blades were popular from the 15th century among the nobility for their resilience, light weight, dexterity and devastating thrusting capabilities. Due to their light weight and potent thrusting abilities, this powerful and effective sword became the prevailing weapon of the 15th C.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Arming swords were exclusively owned by the elite aristocracy (The medieval knight of the time). That said however, arming sword with flattened diamond blades were also used by the foot soldiers. Their use was so common among the knights of the German, French and English forces that it came to be known as the quintessential sword of the medieval knight of the 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Being specifically designed for close quarter combat, we wanted the Sovereign to have superb handling capabilities, an exceptional response and a very good PoB (point of balance). Paying considerable attention to the PoB, the Sovereign is an exceptionally easy sword to handle for both experienced and amateur sword enthusiasts.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The sword is a very responsive sword that feels \u2018alive\u2019 and light in the hand. Easily wieldable even in novice hands, the Sovereign sword\u2019s characteristics make it a medieval weapon of choice for all collectors. The sword is perfectly balance for swift movement and powerful delivery in both cut and thrust.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">While making a sword made to fit the aristocrats of medieval society, the fittings had to be cast in a worthy material. We therefore decided to cast the pommel and guard with bronze, with an antique \u2018pattina\u2019. Bonze pellets are carefully placed in a crucible. The bronze pellets are melted and air forced into the wax molds of the Sovereign.</span>",

The journey took him to Paris, France, the site of the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e, the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet, and incredible Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. While walking through the city he happened upon an old building with massive oaken doors, twenty feet high and ten feet wide. These doors were graced with an extremely ornate door knocker resembling two intertwined snakes. Eyal was so taken by the design that when he returned to Canada he incorporated the theme of intertwined snakes into the hilt and pommel furniture of Darksword\u2019s Barbarian-themed \u201cWarmonger.\u201d <br>\n<br>\nWhile many cultures across Europe and Asia have similar concepts, the modern term \u201cBarbarian\u201d originates in ancient Greece. In its use by these people the term refers to someone from another, typically inferior culture. The Greeks used the word to describe the Turks, and later the Roman Empire would use it in reference to the Celts, Gauls, and Germanic tribes. While the word was pejorative, for the Greeks and Romans there was often an element of guarded respect in its use \u2013 respect for a brave and honourable foe, even in defeat. The expression continued to be used throughout Europe and into the Colonial age, although at that point the use became more condescending than respectful (consider the \u201cnoble savage\u201d ideal and the acts of colonialism). <br>\n<br>\nIn modern culture, Barbarian carries a significantly different meaning \u2013 a meaning that is derived almost entirely from fantasy literature and media. Beginning in the early 20th century, fantasy authors such as Fritz Leiber, Clark Ashton Smith, Michael Moorcock, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the incomparable Robert E. Howard, all began contributing to and defining a subgenre of fantasy called \u201cSword and Sorcery\u201d fiction. Howard\u2019s work in particular was formative, as his characters have been adapted into comics, television shows, and film series. In this genre the Barbarian became something new \u2013 a powerful, bare-chested, muscled warrior, typically from a tribal culture. Clad in leather and metal and wielding a massive two-handed sword, this fictional version of the Celtic/Germanic concept used unearthly skill to carve through armies of hapless foes. Unsurprisingly, this new take on an old concept proved to be wildly popular.<br>\n<br>\nBarbarians got yet another pop culture boost with the advent of tabletop gaming. In 1974 Gary Gygax and David Arneson created Dungeons & Dragons, the first of many editions and versions of role-playing games. The Advanced edition of Dungeons & Dragons introduced the Barbarian as a unique class characterized by a brutal fighting style and a lack of intelligence. The Barbarian overpowered his opponents with sheer strength, serving as the \u201ctank\u201d of the party \u2013 going up front to soak up attacks and deal devastating blows. They also had a unique \u201cRage\u201d ability that allowed them to fight with Berserker fury for a short time. Barbarians remain in Dungeons & Dragons and other role-playing games (including video games) as extremely popular choices, even staples of the role-playing genre. <br>\n<br>\nThe Darksword Armory Warmonger is an homage to the iconic Barbarian character. Conceived by Eyal Azerad and rendered by Darksword Designer Terry Maranda, it embodies all the characteristics of that mythic warrior. This massive weapon is an original design, but would look at home in the hands of any famous fictional Barbarian warrior. Even the scabbard is unique \u2013 wrapped in fur and leather, certainly something a tribal warrior would be seen carrying. The twin snake design is inspired by the door knocker in Paris, given a special Darksword twist. <br>\n<br>\nEven in this civilized age, the Warmonger is a sword fit for the mighty Barbarian in whatever quest they undertake.</p>\n\";s:14:\"_product_video\";s:0:\"\";s:19:\"_product_video_size\";s:0:\"\";s:24:\"_product_video_placement\";s:0:\"\";}}",

Viking craftsmen excelled in woodworking, metalworking and weapons making with abstracted animal forms. Many Viking weapons and ships bore elaborate patterns of interlocking anthropomorphic figures. Runic texts and complementary scenes were frequently inscribed on stone. The Viking love of riddling phrases and schemes of rhyme yielded a rich poetic tradition and tales of mythic events.\n\nThe Vikings are among the most celebrated warriors of human history. Not least due to their own stories and Sagas of epic battles and heroic deeds. For centuries, the Vikings raided and colonized wide areas of Europe. They reached North America centuries before Columbus and traded as far as modern day India. These Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish warriors were prompted to undertake their raids by a combination of sociopolitical factors and overpopulation.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe> At the center of this fierce nomadic culture, stood the Viking sword. No object was praised more among the Vikings than<em> the</em> sword. A rugged broad blade of medium length (avg. 31\") with a wide fuller fading at the tip.&nbsp;While crafting the solid bronze guard and pommel, the essence of the Viking heritage was carefully honored.\n\nThe Oslo Viking Sword is an inspiring Medieval weapon. Authoritative, vibrant and rugged, the Oslo Viking sword is well balanced and a fierce Viking weapon of choice. &nbsp;Inspired by the remains of a 10th C. Viking hilt with elaborated serpentine motifs, the sword remains faithful to its historical counterparts.\n\nWith the sword at the core of Viking history, we engineered the Oslo Viking sword for the most brutal use. Vivid and resilient, the Viking sword is built to last !\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLimited Edition Elite Series Swords\n\nDarksword Armory\u2019s Elite Series swords are individually hand forged, following the strictest guidelines. The Damascus steel blades, guards and pommels are made with a blend of 1095, 5160, L-6 and O1 steel, giving a stunning contrast to the folded steel layering.\n\nDarksword Armoy Elite models are limited to 100 swords worldwide ! Once sold, we will not be making other examples of the same model. Each sword comes with a scabbard, interlaced sword belt and an Elite Series numbered certificate stamped with the \u201cDarksword Elite\u201d Wax seal.

Led by the Roman Catholic church, under Pope Urban II, as a military expedition. The goal was to regain the holy lands lost to Muslims in the conquest of Levant (632-661 A.D.).\n\nThe crusades started when Christians' access to Jerusalem was cut off by the Seljuk Turks after the defeat of the Byzantine army. What followed were a series of crusades that ran for nearly two centuries (1096-1272). The last being led by Edward I.\n\nWith the influence of the Catholic church, all men at arms were bound to use the cruciform sword, with its symbolic cross section, forever historically tied to the imagery of the Crusading Knights. The cruciform guard was imposed by the church to remind all soldiers of their Christian religion and the 'greater' purpose of the war. Ultimately the crusades led to the mass slaughter, rape and devastation on both sides.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>The Crusader sword, like many of its historical counterparts, is regarded as the quintessential sword of the crusading knight. Richly ceremonial due to its symbolic shape, the Cruciform swords of the Crusading period were designed with proportions of perfection of form and harmony. Some sources speak of \"divine proportions\"; a complex geometry which flowed to represent the harmony of nature. The formula of these 'proportions' were used to create 'golden triangles' and 'golden rectangles' which were commonly applied to architectural designs.\n\nIn 'The Noble art of the Sword', Tobia Capwell wrote that the use of the 'divine proportions' led to the belief and acceptance that swords could have artistic merit beyond the notion of 'practicality'.\n\nClassically styled, the Crusader sword was designed with the 'proportions' in mind. The simple yet elegant sword, topped with the circular wheel pommel, was carefully fitted to a blade offering exceptional reflex, balance and control. The sword is responsive, quick, resilient yet flexible. The sword has a sharply tapered cut and thrust blade. When in hand, the sensation, is that of an extension of ones arm. Although minimalist, the crusader sword is of stunning complexity.\n\n-''It is such a tremendous relief to know that my countless hours of research did in fact lead me to finally choose the right swordsmiths! Darksword Armory are everything I'd hoped they would be. I have purchased quite a few ancient and medieval weapons over the last few decades. But the only truly \"battle ready\" sword I owned was an extravagant gift from a dear friend who payed a great deal of money for a magnificent Katana. Frankly, I'd begun to accept the apparent fact that people who do not have \"real\" money, cannot hope to own real swords. But I am very pleased to say that Darksword Armory has demonstrated that this is absolutely NOT the case! My new Sword, and Dagger are everything I'd hoped for... and more! They are beautifully crafted weapons... with excellent balance, strength, and flexibility. They are also \"finished\" to a degree which i have not seen in any of the similarly priced blades i have examined. I got so excited when i first held the Sword that i admit to going a little overboard testing the blade's flexibility and hardness/sharpness lol! I'm pleased as hell to report that no damage occured. &nbsp;DSA is not kidding when they characterize a sword as Battle Ready! Thank you, Darksword Armory!'' &nbsp;-&nbsp;J.

    "content": "Inspirational piece, Norse mythology. 10-11th century\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/pV5D9FanNfQ?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>The Einar Viking Sword is <em>Limited to 800 copies Worldwide</em>\nIt was an age of adventure and savagery. A time when Vikings piled into longships to set out across the seas, raiding and settling the lands they found. But far more than just savage barbarians, they were also farmers, poets, traders, and explorers.\n\nTheir stories can be found in the Vinland Sagas. Part of the Icelandic Sagas, and evoking the legendary names of Einar and Erik the Red, the Vinland Sagas represent the most complete information about the Norse exploration of the Americas and paint a vivid portrait of a heroic world long lost and the amazing people who inhabited it. The Vinland sagas originate from the same land as Njal and Gunnar, as told in Njal\u2019s Saga, two friends whose families\u2019 unending feud would bring them to a violent end. As the tragedy of Njal\u2019s family unfolds, Grettir the Strong\u2019s\nstrength and temper transform him into a hero, an outlaw, and a villain. Across the sea in England, Egil Skallagrimson adds to his legend to become a warrior poet above all others. And, outlawed from his home in the wake of the feud, Erik the Red sails far to the west to discover new&nbsp;lands, founding the doomed settlement known as Vinland\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>The Einar, is inspired from the Vinland sagas and by Norse Mythology. Derived from the Old Norse name Einarr, which according to one of the foremost Scandanavian scholars, Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson, is connected with the concept of the einherjar, undead warriors from Norse mythology. The name, is related to the Old Norse common nouns einar\u00f0r (meaning \"bold\") and ein\u00f6r\u00f0 (meaning \"valour\").\n\nAggregating all essential elements of Viking art and Norse Mythology, the Einar exemplifies the peak of Viking culture.&nbsp;Luxuriously handcrafted from the finest material,&nbsp;the Einar is an distinguished viking sword you will be proud to own. Hand-forged from 5160 high carbon steel and dual tempered, the Einar viking sword is a rugged viking weapon of choice. Well balanced and skilfully engineered, The Einar sword blends the artistic abilities of the Norse people and the central role of warfare in the viking world.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLimited Edition Elite Series Swords\n\nDarksword Armory\u2019s Elite Series swords are individually hand forged, following the strictest guidelines. The Damascus steel blades, guards and pommels are made with a blend of 1095, 5160, L-6 and O1 steel, giving a stunning contrast to the folded steel layering.\n\nDarksword Armoy Elite models are limited to 100 swords worldwide ! Once sold, we will not be making other examples of the same model. Each sword comes with a scabbard, interlaced sword belt and an Elite Series numbered certificate stamped with the \u201cDarksword Elite\u201d Wax seal.

It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom - for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.\u2019\u201d Excerpt from the Declaration of Arbroath, 1320 AD The history of Scotland has no shortage of conflict. A country with a beautiful landscape and rich culture, it has also been a land of strife. Whether fighting with the neighboring English or just warring among the clans, Scotland was an ideal place for great warriors to be born \u2013 and out of those warriors came heroes. One such hero was William Wallace. The historical William Wallace, while generally known to the Scottish population, was up until recently not well known outside of the United Kingdom. Wallace was a member of an upper-class family in Scotland in the late 13th, early 14th century. His early life is something of a mystery, though it is generally believed he had some military experience, possibly as a mercenary.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">As there was no clear ruler of Scotland at the time, Edward I of England appointed himself ruler of Scotland in 1296. Responding with characteristic pride the Scots resisted this appointment in small ways until Wallace began a full-fledged rebellion. Beginning with the murder of a local sheriff Wallace and his compatriots won skirmish after skirmish, culminating in a decisive and astonishing (for the English) victory in the Battle of Stirling Bridge against a vastly overwhelming English force. Wallace was one of several nobles who fought against the English, including Robert the Bruce, later Scotland\u2019s beloved king. Wallace was knighted as a Guardian of Scotland, and continued his successful campaign against the English. Edward I sent an army north to deal with Wallace, and eventually defeated him at Falkirk. Wallace then reportedly left abroad to raise support for their rebellion, which caused him to be excluded from the eventual truce signed between England and Scotland. Wallace was captured near Glasgow in 1305 and taken to England to be tried for treason. Famously declaring that he had committed no treason as he had never sworn allegiance to an English king, Wallace was nonetheless executed \u2013 his head placed on London Bridge, and his limbs sent to the four corners of the kingdom as a warning against treason.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Despite this colourful and action-filled history, William Wallace\u2019s name was relatively unknown to the rest of the world. All of this changed when, in 1995, Actor/Director Mel Gibson launched his epic period film Braveheart. Starring Mel Gibson as William Wallace, the film took significant liberties with the historical facts of Wallace\u2019s life and of that period of Scotland\u2019s history. Wallace now came from a farming family, and had no interest in the rebellion against England until his wife was unjustly killed by an Englishman. Wallace then waged his war of revenge as in history, but has additional \u201cextra-historical\u201d adventures \u2013 including the Battle of Stirling Bridge without a physical bridge being present, historically inaccurate blue face paint, and most jarringly an affair with Prince Edward II\u2019s wife, Isabelle of France (who would have been 4 years old at the time). All the while everyone wears kilts that hadn\u2019t been invented yet. The film also portrays Robert the Bruce as a weak-willed coward who betrayed Wallace to the English \u2013 unforgivable for a Scottish audience. Despite all this, the movie became an instant classic. Much loved around the world, the people of Scotland had a relationship with Braveheart characterized by its dual nature \u2013 hating the film for its inaccuracies while simultaneously loving it for its depiction of Scotland trouncing England in battle repeatedly.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">One Darksword staff on a trip to Scotland in the early 2000\u2019s was chatting with a local in an Edinburgh pub, the local expounding at length all the problems the film had \u2013 but when asked if they\u2019d actually seen the film, the replied, \u201cOh aye, I\u2019ve seen it six times.\u201d Clearly, a film that caused significant cultural impact. One of the most recognizable features of the Braveheart film is the sword wielded by William Wallace. Almost a fantasy version of a Scottish claymore, it is utterly unique among both film swords and historically inspired replicas. A long, double edge blade is married to a cruciform hilt and long handle for extra torque when swinging, and a traditional Claymore ball pommel completes the fittings \u2013 however, it is the ricasso that truly stands out. Unlike other swords of this type the William Wallace Claymore has a leather-wrapped ricasso, creating a comfortable place for a fighter to shorten up their grip for close-range work. Fans of the film, and fans of Scottish history, can both appreciate the impact that <i>Braveheart</i> has had on popular culture \u2013 and this sword was a part of that impact. Like the movie itself, it may not be historical - but it is inspired. It may not have been carried by heroes in the past, but it is representative of the swords they would have carried - an idealized weapon for an idolized character in film history.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">One of the most recognizable features of the Braveheart film is the sword wielded by William Wallace.

A wolf pack was representative of attributes like strength, loyalty, and a stark reminder of the mortality and doom of man. Across the whole Nordic world you would be hard pressed to find a greater symbol of royalty and power than this most graceful and deadly creature. The wolf, and the wolf pack, feature heavily in the Icelandic sagas and other stories throughout human history. Wolves are known as social animals. Their greatest strength is not their speed, their claws, or their fangs, but their ability to work together to bring down greater foes. It is this pack mentality that defines their being and has captured the imaginations of cultures around the world for centuries.</span></h2>\n</div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">It is also why the \"lone wolf\" concept is so simultaneously fascinating, and heartbreaking. A lone wolf may have lost their pack, or left it behind, or been cast out - but they still persevere. Running in the moonlight, fighting for survival, refusing to give in to loneliness or despair. Lone wolves, while rare in nature, have become symbols for people who feel they are on the \"outside\" - of society, family, or the social norms that constrain them.</span></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Eindride is a sword for the lone wolf, the wanderer, the outcast. Someone who, for a time at least, is separated from their pack. This sword's cast bronze guard features snarling wolf heads on the hilt, accented by traditional knotwork. A simple bronze scentstopper pommel and wooden grip complement the elaborate hilt. The blade has a thick ricasso that transitions into a single fuller double edged design that has norse runes inscribed, reading, \"One Who Rides Alone\" - a snarl from the indomitable heart of the lone wolf. The Eindride was designed with these people in mind, in honour of their unbreakable spirits, to be their companion when no one else is. We hope it will keep you safe on the journey.</span>\n\n</div>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_24336\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"]<img class=\"wp-image-24336 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/the-eindride-lone-wolf-medieval-sword-bare-blade-full-tang-1545-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"the-eindride-lone-wolf-medieval-sword-bare-blade-full-tang-1545\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"> The Eindride Lone Wolf Sword, prior to assembly.[/caption]",

    "content": "The battle of Agincourt, fought between the French and English forces as part of the hundred years war, took place on October 25<sup>th</sup> 1415, near Calais. Two months prior, Henry had crossed the English Channel with 11,000 men and laid siege to Harfleur in Normandy. The town surrendered after five weeks of intense siege. The siege however cost Henry V half his men. Given the depleting numbers, he decided to march his army northeast to Calais and return to England. At Agincourt however, a massive French army of 20,000 men stood in his path, greatly outnumbering the exhausted English archers, knights, and men-at-arms.\n\nThe English, starved and outnumbered, defeated the French forces and effectively crippled France. Due to Henry V\u2019s brilliant military strategy, the English forces only suffered 600 casualties, while the French lost an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 solders.\n\nThe battle of Agincourt is recorded as one of the most decisive and important battles of the medieval era. It effectively marked the end of French supremacy over England and led to a reluctant diplomatic alliance between the English and French crown. Following the Battle of Agincourt, Henry V married the French king\u2019s daughter, Catherine de Valois, and their son became the disputed King of France.\n\nThe Henry V coin shows the seal of Henry V along with the commemorative date of the Battle of Agincourt. The coin\u2019s backside displays the coat of Arms of the House of Lancaster, along with the dates of Henry V\u2019s rule as King of England (20 March 1413 \u2013 31 August 1422).\n\nThe coin can either be ordered in Silver or Bonze.\n\nCollectible Medieval Commemorative Coin\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Dimensions</span></strong>\n<p class=\"animated fadeIn\" style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;\">Diameter: 5 inches</p>\n<p class=\"animated fadeIn\" style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;\">Width: 8.5mm</p>\n<p class=\"animated fadeIn\" style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;\">Weight: 1lb</p>\n<p class=\"animated fadeIn\" style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;\">Material: Zinc</p>\n<p class=\"animated fadeIn\" style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;\">&nbsp;</p>",

The fitting of the long 'claw' guard to the blade was no easy endeavor. While the guard and pommel are crafted from solid bronze, the blade is forged from 5160 High Carbon Steel, dual hardened at a Rockwell of 60 at the cutting edge and 48-50 at the core.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The design for the barbarian sword began as an inspirational piece while Eyal, the owner of Darksword, was in Paris. While walking he stumbled on a beautiful door knocker with intertwining snakes. The result was a brainstorming session with our designer to finally create the Warmonger.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Imposing, intimidating and brutish, the Warmonger is the quintessential fantasy sword, capable of delivering devastating blows. The mythic blade, with its crisp deep fuller, is inspired the Viking swords recounted in the legendary sages of the northern peoples, known as&nbsp;<i><b>fornaldarsaga. &nbsp;</b></i>The Warmonger sword is individually hand forged and battle ready. The impressive resilient crisp blade is specifically engineered to penetrate plate armor with searing strength.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Brutish yet refined, the Warmonger sword is in a class by itself. Relatively light, responsive and classically styled, the Warmonger Barbarian sword delivers what it was designed to do! Backed by our commitment and reputation for forging some of the most durable swords in the industry, the Warmonger is faithfully crafted and stands as a legacy to the fantasy lore of the Warrior Norse mythology.</span>\n\n.<img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Warmonger-Barbarian-sword-Web2-533x1024-416x800.jpg\" alt=\"The-Warmonger-Barbarian-sword-Web2-533x1024\">\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Limited Edition Elite Series Swords</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Darksword Armory\u2019s Elite Series swords are individually hand forged, following the strictest guidelines. The Damascus steel blades, guards and pommels are made with a blend of 1095, 5160, L-6 and O1 steel, giving a stunning contrast to the folded steel layering.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Darksword Armory Elite models are limited to 100 swords worldwide ! Once sold, we will not be making other examples of the same model. Each sword comes with a scabbard, interlaced sword belt and an Elite Series numbered certificate stamped with the \u201cDarksword Elite\u201d Wax seal. Each certificate is individually signed by Eyal Azerad, owning founder of Darksword Armory Inc.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">We are confident that our Elite Series swords will impress even the most discriminating collector.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDelay note: If we do not have your Elite Series Piece in stock, please expect a wait time of approximately 6-12 months.",

As for many, John Boorman\u2019s 1981 Epic Film was not only my favorite movie but, as a child, my introduction to the \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d.\n\nThis introduction, crystalized \u201cThe Excalibur\u201d at the core of my passion and a romanticized vision of the \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d. Hence, forging the Excalibur sword, was a passion project for myself and the staff alike. We felt we owed this sword our utmost attention. Making yet another \u201cdecorative\u201d Excalibur was not an option. Our recreation had to be classically elegant, vibrant, and faithfully crafted from the original prop. Our goal was not only to produce a finely hand forged sword, but to produce a lasting legacy of the film.\n\nThe Excalibur is an authoritative, functional and resilient sword. skillfully crafted and engineered for the most demanding collector, the Excalibur is the benchmark of what a real sword should be.\n\n5160 High Carbon Steel\nDual hardened&nbsp;tempered to a Rockwell of 53\nTotal length: 17\u2033\nBlade length: 12\u2033\nHandle length: 3 1/4\u2033\nBlade width at base: 1 1/2\u2033\nWeight: &nbsp;1lbs 0oz",

But in times like these, well, it should be fought by another kind of evil.\u201d \u2013 Aereon, The Chronicles of Riddick</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">When we read fantasy stories, we often do it to escape. A rousing adventure story filled with danger, epic quests, and heroic escapes can distract us from the drudgery (or the difficulty) of our everyday lives. These tales are most often filled with heroes \u2013 people who seek to rescue the princess, save the kingdom, find the magic sword, or undertake whatever obligations the tale might require. These heroes are people we look up to, who we idolize, and who we would like to come and rescue us if we needed it one day.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">However, some stories are not about heroes. Heroes are generally good, and operate with overall positive systems of morality. Anti-heroes, on the other hand, aren\u2019t necessarily good. They might even be bad \u2013 just pointed in a direction that furthers the plot and might bring down the villain\u2019s plans. Maybe we don\u2019t actually want the anti-hero to come and save us, since we know that when they do things don\u2019t always go so well. Things get messy and there\u2019s collateral damage, and the anti-hero doesn\u2019t always care about the people they are rescuing necessarily \u2013 they might care more about killing their enemies or getting revenge than anything else.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Many classic anti-heroes exist in fantasy fiction, and their tales fill us with fascination. Conan was one of the earliest, depicted as a barbarian and a thief as opposed to a knight in shining armor. Fitzchivalry Farseer from Robin Hobb\u2019s Elderlings is a royal bastard and failed assassin whose lies and poor choices wreck his every relationship. Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher book, game, and Netflix series is a killer for hire and initially has little interest in destiny. Thomas Covenant from Stephen R. Donaldson\u2019s Chronicles of Thomas Covenant series might be the best (worst?) example, a prophesied saviour who winds up being a foul tempered, unrepentant rapist. And then there\u2019s basically everyone in the Game of Thrones series.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Anti-heroes might not be good, or even nice. But they are also what we sometimes need \u2013 and may be more reflective of the real world than many other fantasy heroes.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">The Erland sword, \u2018outsider or foreigner\u2019 in old Norse, personifies the modern vision of the anti-hero. The savage design was inspired by the dark artistic vision of artists like Frank Frazetta, Boris Vallego, and Seb Mckinnon. The art of Frank Frazetta especially depicts the image of the anti-hero and lone warrior with a sense of power, respect and authority amidst a precarious and treacherous world. Franzetta\u2019s exquisite work includes famous paintings of Conan the Barbarian which defined a generation of fantasy artwork.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Individually hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel and dual hardened, the Erland sword is the new evolved edition of the Guardian Sword. This double-edged weapon is solidly built and would withstand considerable use by a fearsome barbarian. The dragon claw guard and heavy pommel are cast from solid bronze, giving the sword a forbidding look. As a full two-handed sword it would be best used in broad, sweeping cuts \u2013 or even cutting someone down off of a charging horse. It is a powerful, functional fantasy sword, one that would be evil\u2019s worst nightmare in the hands of another kind of evil.</span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_24320\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"]<img class=\"wp-image-24320 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/eindride-sword-full-tang-battle-ready-fully-functional-medieval-weapon-darksword-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"eindride-sword-full-tang-battle-ready-fully-functional-medieval-weapon-darksword\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"> The Erland Sword, prior to assembly.[/caption]",

Numerous examples survive in museums and private collections, and virtually all of them are single-handed weapons. And with good reason \u2013 Viking hand-to-hand combat revolved around the shield, typically a wooden circle with steel cladding around the edge and a pointed steel boss. In order for the shield to function properly a single-handed weapon was necessary, and the Viking sword was a natural companion.\n\nViking swords are frequently reproduced by modern makers, and given the multitude of Viking swords on the market one wonders whether the market is saturated. Many reproductions however, play into the stereotype of Viking swords as little more than long cleavers \u2013 heavy, brutish weapons wielded by brutal people. These reproductions fail to capture the spirit or \u201cfunction\u201d of the Viking sword as an important step in the evolution of the European medieval swords, from earlier Romanesque style to the arming swords of the late medieval period. For the most part, Darksword Armory Viking Swords go against the modern trend of producing unbalanced, unwieldy Viking Swords.\n\nThis is what makes the Guardlan Sword so unique. For one, the blade is extended past what the average Viking would wield. The longer blade necessitates the handle being extended, turning the Guardlan into a true two-handed weapon \u2013 unlike the vast majority of Viking swords.&nbsp;\n\nThis is not to say that the Guardlan has no basis in history. The basic design is still within the typical typology of the Viking sword - the most authoritative typology of the Viking swords was the Peterson Typology, written by Dr. Jan Peterson in 1919. Focusing on variations in pommel and guards to formulate a 26 category scheme, Jan Perterson created a typo-logical reference to determine the date of each sub type. The distinct pommel identifies the Guardlan as a Type R, or \u201cFive Lobe\u201d style, one of the most recognizable types of Viking pommels.\n\nThe blade has the distinctive wide fuller and spatulate tip typical of designs from the Viking era, making it a predominantly slashing weapon. While using a Type 4 blade from the Geibig Typology, we fitted the five lobe Viking medieval sword with an extended handle that is long\n\nenough for a comfortable two handed grip. The type 4 blade, found from the mid-tenth century through the mid-eleventh century, features a slight taper and a fuller which extends the blade\u2019s full length. The Guardlan sword is battle ready and features a 30 inch blade, forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel and dual hardened.\n\nWe carefully crafted this Viking medieval sword to reflect the Norse cultural and artistic heritage. Exceptional tools of war, the Viking medieval swords also attest to the Viking culture\u2019s keen interest in art and aesthetic beauty. We hope you can appreciate the work that went into creating this unique piece inspired by the exceptional craftsmen of the Viking era.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>The sword can be ordered in various scabbard options (standard, With an interlaced sword belt, or Deluxe Embossed with a Belt and bronze buckles)</em></strong>\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-67335 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/scabbard-options-506x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"506\" height=\"800\">",

    "content": "<em>This knife is one of our special <strong>Urnes Staves Church </strong>blades. A 12<sup>th</sup> century stave church located in Norway, the Urnes Stave Church is renowned for its many examples of unique iconography including classic examples of Viking knotwork. While a site of Christian worship from the early 11<sup>th</sup> to the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, many of the thematic elements in the artwork are thought to be of old Norse origin. Certain knives in the Halstein Forge line belong to a special collection inspired by the Urnes Stave Church \u2013 knotwork on the handles has been taken from the designs in the church itself. We hope you will be inspired, as we were, to learn more about this special church and its rich history.</em>\n\nIn most tribal cultures, the position of chieftain is one of great importance and carries with it an air of power balanced with responsibility. Nowhere is that more true than in Norse culture. For the Norse peoples, the position of chieftain (called \u201cJarl\u201d) was one that was both feared and respected. Jarls ruled their people, while not always gently or kindly, with iron resolve. Surviving information from the Viking era suggests that, for the Norse people, a Jarl was more than just a leader \u2013 he was father to his people, their provider and protector. The title and concept of the Jarl as wise and powerful chieftain has moved beyond the pages of history; from the History Channel\u2019s popular show \u201cVikings\u201d to the Nord nobility in the popular <em>Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</em> video game, the term Jarl has become a part of our popular culture.\n\nThe Halstein Forge Jarl knife is inspired by this traditional position of power. The blade itself is a simple traditional belt knife, as would be common for any Norse warrior to carry for tasks martial and mundane. However, the combination of the beautiful Damascus steel (which is historically plausible, as Viking smiths did discover the secrets of pattern-welding) and the oaken handle carved with Norse knotwork from the Urnes Stave Church makes this more than a simple tool. This knife is a beautiful piece of functional craftsmanship, worthy to be carried by a Jarl as he \u2013 or she \u2013 protects and guides their family.\n\nFinely crafted Damascus steel Knives by skilled blade smiths, each knife is individually crafted, sculpted assembled and refined by a team of skilled knife makers.\n\nClassic elegance with stunning complexity, each knife presents its own character, geometry, and elegance, combining functionality with artistry, rending each unique collectible knife into a true work of art.\n\nA subdivision of world renowned sword makers, Darksword Armory inc., Halstein Forge individually hand crafts each knife in their shop located in Montreal, Canadian.\n\nThe Jarl, meaning Chieftain, is forged with\u00a0blend of blend of 1075 and 8670m steel, giving a stunning contrast to the folded steel layering.\n\nSpecs:\nTotal length: 13.3 inches\nGrip: 5.3 inches\nweight: 6.55 oz",

Viking craftsmen excelled in woodworking, metalworking and weapons making with abstracted animal forms. Many <a href=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapons/medieval-axes/axes-viking-axes/\">Viking weapons</a> and ships bore elaborate patterns of interlocking anthropomorphic figures. Runic texts and complementary scenes were frequently inscribed on stone. The Viking love of riddling phrases and schemes of rhyme yielded a rich poetic tradition and tales of mythic events.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Book Antiqua', serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Vikings are among the most celebrated warriors of human history. Not the least due to their own stories and Sagas of epic battles and heroic deeds. For centuries, the Vikings raided and colonized wide areas of Europe. They reached North America centuries before Columbus and traded as far as modern day India. These Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish warriors were prompted to undertake their raids by a combination of socio-political factors and overpopulation. As a result, Norse culture permeated all of Western Europe and greatly influenced the development of many modern nations.</span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\">\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n<span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua','serif';\">At the center of this fierce nomadic culture, stood the Viking sword. No object was praised more among the Vikings than<em><span style=\"font-family: 'Book Antiqua','serif';\"> the</span></em> sword. While other Viking weapons, such as the axe or spear, were important mainstays of Viking martial life, the sword was viewed with special reverence \u2013 not only for its utility in combat, but also due to the incredible skill involved in their construction. Smithing the long, tempered blades with the technology available at the time was tremendously difficult, and the evolution of the Viking sword is a testament to the Viking smiths\u2019 steady growth in expertise.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua','serif';\">This evolution was first described by Dr Jan Petersen, a Norwegian archaeologist who lived in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Petersen studied the development of Viking sword smithing and published his results in his dissertation, \u201cThe Norwegian Viking Swords: A Typological-Chronological Study of Viking Age Weaponry.\u201d This revolutionary typology was the first of its kind, and laid the groundwork for later typologies (such as Ewart Oakeshott\u2019s typology of the medieval sword).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua','serif';\">Petersen\u2019s typology traces the ascension of the Viking sword from its humble beginnings \u2013 the Type A, a flat, simple broad blade that existed at the end of the Frankish dynasty known as the Merovingian period and early Viking Age (from roughly 700-800CE). Early Types, such as Types B and C, contain double-edged and single-edged examples. Later examples were primarily double-edged and distinguished mainly by differences in the hilt \u2013 once established, the Viking blade varied little in the later years of the era.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Darksword Armory Oslo Viking Sword is based on these later examples, and most closely resembles the Petersen Type D (primarily used from 850-900 AD). Unlike later medieval swords which were used for cut-and-thrust, Viking swords were designed primarily for slashing \u2013 this was to counter the leather armour of the time, which allowed swords to be devastatingly effective on the battlefield. Chain links would part beneath the heavy blows this weapon could inflict, and lesser armored opponents would be helpless against such blades.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Like most Viking swords (which Oakeshott would later lump together under Type X in his typology), the sword has a rugged broad blade of medium length (avg. 31\u2033) with a wide fuller fading at the tip.&nbsp;This transfers much of the weight towards the tip of the blade, producing a high point-of-balance and giving the sword tremendous chopping power.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua','serif';\">As in the later examples of Petersen\u2019s typology, the hilt is the biggest differentiating factor \u2013 and while crafting the solid bronze guard and pommel, the essence of the Viking heritage was carefully honored. Norse knotwork \u2013 a consistent feature of Viking culture \u2013 is skillfully imbued into the bronze guard using the lost wax process with designs are based on historical examples. The grip is meticulously engraved solid ebony.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua','serif';\">Skillfully crafted from 5160 High Carbon steel, the Oslo Viking Sword is an inspiring weapon. Authoritative, vibrant and rugged, the Oslo Viking sword is well balanced and a fierce Viking weapon of choice. &nbsp;Inspired by the remains of a 10th C. Viking hilt with elaborated serpentine motifs, the sword remains faithful to its historical counterparts.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Book Antiqua','serif';\">The sword has always been at the core of Viking history. As a result, we engineered the Oslo Viking sword for the same kind of brutal use that the original historical examples would have been put to.

    "content": "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Two Handed Medieval Sword</span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Late 15th century \u2013 German. Original found in the Landesmuseum, Zurich.\nType XVIIIb.</p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Two Handed Medieval sword, was very popular in Germany during the mid to late 15th century. As the Middle Ages progressed, this versatile Sword continued to evolve according to the battlefield requirements of the day. The dedicated cutting designs of the 13th century gave way to the thrusting oriented swords of the late Medieval Era.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">By the Gothic period, the type XVIIIb two handed sword, with its rigid diamond shaped needle tip blade, became the most essential part of the medieval Knight's arsenal. The hollow ground sword blades were not only capable of powerful cuts, but offered exceptional advantages with their keen ability to piece through the ever developing plate armor.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Not only did the fifteenth century longsword possess a blade profile that allowed for effective thrusting, it also retained a large measure of its earlier ancestor's cutting ability. The simple, yet elegant simplistic geometry of the sword reflects the Gothic artistic revival that not only inspired bladesmiths and armorers but also architects and painters of the period. The deeply hollow ground blade and clean hexagonal quillions and fishtail pommel attest to this artistic revival. Swords during this period were not only exceptionally engineered, but also reflected clear artistic patterns and influences from the gothic architectual structures of the time. Hence, the Two Handed Gothic medieval sword, and thus Type XVIIIb medieval battle ready swords, were not merely weapons of war, but beautifully crafted artistic pieces in their own right.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"float: left;

Rounded, globular, conical, and pointed variations of the helmets were all popular.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The method of attachment and shape of the faceplate or visor changed continuously to offer better protection, visibility, breathing, ventilation and decoration. Visors were removable and held in place by locking pins and could be attached by a central pin (klappvisor) or by two hinges on the sides of the helmet. The visor had various shapes; flat, conical or round convex.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Wallace Bascinet Helmet is dated between 1380 -1410 and a Northern Italian design. The classic pointed visor commonly results in this type of helmet being referred to as a \u201chound skull\u201d or \u201cpig face\u201d bascinet. This type of visor was effective at deflecting blows and its elongated shape improved breathing and ventilation. The visor could be opened or removed as battle conditions dictated. The visor of this helmet is held in place by two removable hinge pins and moves up and down to open or close on two pivot points, one on each side of the helmet.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The the inside of the helmet has a cloth, hand sewn liner/arming cap (sewn to holes made around the helmet) to cushion and protect the head and straps to secure the helmet on the head.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Twenty one brass vervelles or rivets that run along the bottom and side edges of the face of the helmet allow an aventail (mail covering the neck and shoulders) to be attached. The removable aventail has been blackened and is made from butted mail. The mail is attached to a leather band which has holes that fit over the vervelles to attach it to the helmet. Once the aventail is attached, a copper wire runs through the holes in the vervelles to secure the aventail to the helmet.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Interior surfaces of the helmet have been painted black to reduce maintenance.</span></div>",

It was a key piece of a suit of plate armor and was formed fitted to the contours of the head, neck and throat to fully enclose the head.</span></div>\n<div class=\"\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\">The Closed Helmet is often confused with the Armet. The term \u201cArmet\u201d during contemporary times was used to define any helmet which fully enclosed the head. Modern scholars however, have developed a new classification - the Close Helm or Closed Helmet. Both are very similar in appearance and period of use, but are distinguished based upon the method by which they could be opened to be worn. The Armet had hinged cheek plates which opened to allow the helmet to fit over the head; while the Closed Helmet had a moveable bevor (chin and neck guard) that was attached to the same pivot points as the visor and opened vertically to allow the helmet to fit over the head.</span></div>\n<div class=\"\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"\"><span class=\"\">The helmet is fashioned with a crest on top of the bowl that was effective at deflecting blows. The visor has a single eye slit and can be opened separately or can be attached to the ventail via a stud. The ventail has ventilation slits on both sides and can be fixed in place over a stud/peg on the helmet. The visor and ventail can be opened separately or together when connected and share the same pivot points. The bevor has three articulated sections and is secured in place with a locking hook. The Closed Helmet has an adjustable leather liner/suspension system and chin strap.</span></div>\n</div>",

It\u2019s development paralleled the development and advancements of armor and was an essential piece of a suit of plate armor. The head was fully enclosed by the helmet which was formed fit to the contours of the head, neck and throat.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The term \u201cArmet\u201d during contemporary times was used to define any helmet which fully enclosed the head. Modern scholars however, have developed a new classification - the Close Helm or Closed Helmet. Both are very similar in appearance and period of use, but are distinguished based upon the method by which they could be opened to be worn. The Armet had hinged cheek plates which opened to allow the helmet to fit over the head; while the Close Helm had a moveable bevor (chin and neck guard) that was attached to the same pivot points as the visor and opened vertically to allow the helmet to fit over the head.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">\u201cThe Armet\u201d would be considered a Close Helm by todays classification.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #222222; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The helmet is fashioned with a large, centered crest on top of the bowl that was effective at deflecting blows. The visor has two separate eye slits. The ventail has ventilation holes on both sides. The visor and ventail can be opened separately and share the same pivot points. The bevor can be secured in place with a locking hook.</span></div>",

Baldwin granted their request and they became the Poor Fellow Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon or more commonly the Templars. The Templars are not only one of the most famous, militarily formidable and mythologized organizations of the Middle Ages, but they continue to entertain and captivate us in modern literature, entertainment and games.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Great Helm or Heaume was in use in the 12th, 13th and 14th Centuries and saw many improvements in form and design during that period. The flat top became rounded or conical to better deflect blows, the face and neck pieces lengthened to provide better protection and ventilation was improved by the addition of holes and design cutouts to improve air flow in the faceplate. Great Helms had no moveable parts and were generally worn over mail and/or cloth coifs. They were heavy, hot and restricted movement and vision. However, they provided vastly superior protection to predecessors helmets. The Fantasy Templar Helm is an example for a Great Helm at its peak.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Fantasy Templar Helm is conical in shape and protects the entire head, face and neck.

The four halflings crawl into a hollow under the roots of a great oak tree while the Nazgul searches for them \u2013 coming very close indeed. So close, in fact, that at one point it hovers over them, filling the Hobbits with overwhelming fear. The Nazgul remains shrouded in its black cloak, the only part visible is the iron gauntlet that it grips the twisted oak roots with \u2013 and even the slight glimpse of that gauntlet is enough to instill a deep sense of dread.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nInspired from the Nazgul medieval armor gauntlets in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we have created one of the most complex and detailed gauntlets on the market today. Each gauntlet has 158 rivets with 58 moveable parts, permitting exceptional articulation and range of motion. The gauntlets are made of 16 g steel (Leather gloves are included), making them suitable for reenactment, cosplay, or the Renn faire. The adjustable leather straps allow a perfect fit, letting you terrorize diminutive heroes in relative comfort.",

Thanks to decades of scholarly research we have been able to faithfully reproduce dozens of swords found in museums, private collections, and other historical sources. These battle ready swords are able to withstand the rigors of actual combat, while remaining true to the size, weight, and dimensions of the originals. We have also been called upon to make swords for television and film in the past, but this new\n\n<img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-31674 alignright\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/got-dakrsword-armory-building-the-iron-throne-game-of-thrones-1-340x340.jpg\" alt=\"got-dakrsword-armory-building-the-iron-throne-game-of-thrones-1\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\">\n\n&nbsp;endeavor goes above and beyond anything they have attempted before.\n\nDarksword being a fan of the Game of Thrones series and the books on which they were based for years. Recently, the team of smiths decided to create their version of the Iron Throne as a tribute to George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic work and to the countless artists who have created the most&nbsp;\n\npopular fantasy series in TV history. This considerable undertaking is all the more significant when one considers the importance of the Iron Throne in the Game of Thrones series.\n\nIn the fictional land of Westeros, the city of King\u2019s Landing is the location from which the King of the Andals rules over the Seven Kingdoms. In the great hall of the Red Keep, the King sits upon the Iron Throne, a twisted relic of victory. Aegon the Conqueror had the throne forged from the weapons of those he defeated, supposedly twisting together more than a thousand swords and fusing them with dragon\u2019s fire. Far more than an intimidating place from which the King would pronounce judgement, one significant feature of the Iron Throne is that the blades were kept sharp when the throne was created. Thus, a King would never sit easily on his seat of power, and popular rumor held that any king who cut himself upon the throne was unfit to rule.\n\n<img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-31672 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/got-dakrsword-armory-building-the-iron-throne-game-of-thrones-3-340x340.jpg\" alt=\"got-dakrsword-armory-building-the-iron-throne-game-of-thrones-3\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\">\n\nInspired by the fictional Iron Throne, the team have recreated the Iron Throne in modern steel. The base construction of the first real Iron Throne is a steel frame that was forged out of flat bars of stock metal. After more than 20 years of operations, Darksword Armory had a stock of swords that had not passed inspection due to cosmetic imperfections. These swords formed the seat, arms, sides, and back of the Iron Throne. Each sword was carefully shaped, altered, and placed according to our exact design, which required treating the project like a giant puzzle. Several swords from their \u201cFlame of the Angels\u201d design were placed intact on the back of the throne to mimic the iconic silhouette of this Game of Thrones homage piece. Every member of Darksword\u2019s team who worked on this project was honored to be involved and pay tribute to George R. R. Martin\u2019s imaginative fantasy series.\n\nAfter months of work, Darksword Armory is pleased to present their version of the Iron Throne.

From antiquity and medieval sources we hear tales of heroes and faeries, gods and monsters, that have passed from legend into scholarship and popular culture. One of the most prominent figures in Irish lore, however, was not an individual but an office - the Ard-R\u00ed, High King over all Ireland, who brought together the smaller warring kingdoms under one rule.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Inspiration and Development</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The High Kings of Ireland purportedly ruled over Ireland from 1500 BC until the Norman invasion in the late 12th century AD, though scholars are quick to point out that much of that early history is considered to be mythological. According to tradition, the list of High Kings includes many heroes of Irish lore including Lugh of the Long Arm. Lugh is a famous heroic figure in Irish mythology, having ruled as High King for two decades as well as being a member of the Tuath D\u00e9 Danann, the pantheon of the ancient Irish people. As High King, Lugh was granted Fragarach, the sword of the sea god Manann\u00e1n mac Lir. The magic blade Fragarach (Gaelic for \"The Answerer\") was a powerful sword forged by the gods and capable of cutting down the walls of a city. The legends also stated no one could lie when The Answerer was held to their throat as it magically compelled people to speak the truth. Fragarach passed through the hands of several of Ireland's High Kings, and is one of several mythic weapons associated with the seat of power that ruled over Ireland for over 2000 years. The Darksword Armory High King Sword is inspired by those legends.</span>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Distinctive Features</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">One of the most distinctive features of this particular sword is the pommel, which has an open ring shape. This style is typically called an \u201cIrish Ring Hilt,\u201d and has been seen on historical Irish swords as well as examples in Celtic artwork. It has also made its appearance in modern fantasy, most recently on the sword belonging to the warrior known as \u201cThe Mountain\u201d in HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones. The High King takes some of its inspiration from all of those sources, and is our take on a mythological Irish weapon once wielded by those ancient rulers.</span>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Darksword's Take</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">This is our largest swords to date. The massive 2 1/4\" inch broad blade is designed with the claymore in mind, able to be an effective weapon for single combat or in large battles. A foot soldier with this in hand would be able to sweep a knight in armor off of their heavy horse and finish them off on the ground. The 12 inch handle allows for a wide, two-handed grip, maximising the torque that can be applied in each swing. The tang on this sword is wide and thick, and becomes visible when it passes through the open pommel. The guard is a slightly curved modern design, which is our way of adding a personal touch on this piece that is inspired from history, mythology, and fantasy.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Specifications</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Hand forged from 5160 High Carbon Steel</span>\n\nDifferential Hardened at a Rockwell of 60 at the Edge; 48-50 at the core.\nFittings: Mild Steel\nHandle: Red Oak Wrapped in Leather\n\nTotal length: 58\"\nBlade length: 43\"\nBlade width at base: 2 1/4\"\nWeight: 4 lbs 15 oz.\nPOB: 9\"\n\nDistal Taper :&nbsp; &nbsp; Base: 5.8mm | Midpoint: 4.2mm | Tip: 3.3mm\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-50499\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/the-sword-of-the-mountain-game-of-thrones-got-darksword-armory-966x2048-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1427\" height=\"1435\">",

Still others are known to us because of myth; Excalibur, for example, or Hrunting, the sword of Beowulf. Rarest of all, though, are the swords in which history and legend meet, and overlap, and leave us with an artifact rooted in history and wrapped in mythology. The sword of Charlemagne, first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, is one such legendary weapon.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles I was the eldest son of the Frankish king Pepin the Short. After his father\u2019s death he became king, beginning his rule over the Franks when he was only in his 20\u2019s. A highly religious man, he began a campaign to strengthen the position of the Catholic Church in Europe. This led to military campaigns against the Slavs, the Moors, and a 30-year religious war against the Saxons that served to establish his credentials as a leader and military commander. It was these actions that united Western Europe into the Holy Roman Empire, an Empire over which Charlemagne was made emperor in the year 800 CE by then Pope Leo III. Some historical sources suggest that Charlemagne was unaware of the Pope\u2019s plans to make him emperor and took the seat with reluctance \u2013 this has been disputed by many historians.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Charlemagne was to rule the empire for 14 years, and despite his sometimes brutal military campaigns he also made many educational reforms \u2013 creating libraries and expanding budgets for schools, as well as increasing the perceived value of literature, scholarship, and music. Upon his death the empire passed to his son, and he was buried in a cathedral in what would one day be Western Germany. The history of Charlemagne contains a strange mix of fact and fiction, and nowhere is this more evident than in the tale of his sword.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Called Joyeuse (\u201cJoyful\u201d in French), Charlemagne\u2019s sword was the stuff of legend. The origins of the sword are suitably fantastical; it was supposedly of the same make as the legendary sword Durendal, which was brought to earth from heaven by an angel. Other sources suggest that it was forged from, or at least partially contained, part of the spear that pierced the side of Christ as he hung from the cross. Joyeuse supposedly had a dazzling appearance \u2013 The Song of Roland, a famous 11<sup>th</sup>-century epic poem that depicts a period of Charlemagne\u2019s reign, describes the sword thusly:</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><em>\u201c\"[Charlemagne] was wearing his fine white coat of mail and his helmet with gold-studded stones; by his side hung Joyeuse, and never was there a sword to match it; its colour changed thirty times a day.\"</em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fate of Charlemagne\u2019s sword remains unknown; however, a sword that is purported to have been his has been used at the coronation of French kings since the 12<sup>th</sup> century. This sword was kept with other articles of ceremonial regalia in the royal abbey of Saint-Denis and brought out for ceremony. Moved to the <em>Mus\u00e9e du Louvre</em> in 1793, the artifact \u2013 now referred to as the true Sword of Charlemagne \u2013 was used one last time at the coronation of Charles X before being retired to the Louvre where it remains to this day.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">While the identity of this sword as belonging to Charlemagne is unconfirmed, it is certainly a piece of stunning beauty. The famous golden handle appears to be a composite piece \u2013 the winged dragon crossguard, for example, is from the 12<sup>th</sup> century, while the handle appears to have been made in the 13<sup>th</sup> or 14<sup>th</sup> century. The pommel, however, appears to be ornamented in the style of 10<sup>th</sup> or 11<sup>th</sup> century Scandinavia, suggesting it may be the oldest piece of hardware on the sword. The age of the blade is disputed, with dates ranging anywhere from the 9<sup>th</sup> century (making it possible to have indeed been Charlemagne\u2019s sword) to the 13<sup>th</sup> century (putting its identity as the fabled Joyeuse in doubt). Despite its uncertain origin, the sword currently displayed in the Louvre is carries a rich history and is traditionally associated with the sword carried by the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Darksword Armory Charlemagne Sword is one of our most anticipated project to date, and has been in development since Darksword Armory founder Eyal Azarad\u2019s visit to the Louvre. A broad, solid blade with a single fuller matches the antique on display, and is made from 5160 high carbon steel as are all our blades. The tang for this sword was made especially thick in order to provide additional stability. The hilt furniture, however, is where the quality of our work truly shines. The original handle, cross guard, and pommel are made from gold, and many modern reproductions use brass or gold-plated metal; Darksword Armory uses the lost wax process to cast the hilt furniture out of bronze. The incredible detail on our version of Joyeuse, one of the only battle-ready versions of Charlemagne\u2019s sword available today. We hope that you will enjoy our take on this sword of history and legend.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-28066 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/joyeuse-charlemagne-hilt-sword-museum-louvre-2-340x340.jpg\" alt=\"joyeuse-charlemagne-hilt-sword-museum-louvre-2\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\"> <img class=\"wp-image-28067 size-thumbnail alignleft\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/joyeuse-charlemagne-hilt-sword-museum-louvre-340x340.jpg\" alt=\"joyeuse-charlemagne-hilt-sword-museum-louvre\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Specifications</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 95%;\">Hand forged from 5160 High Carbon Steel\nDifferential Hardened at a Rockwell of 60 at the Edge; 48-50 at the core.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%;\">Fittings: Bronze</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%;\">Total length: 34 1/4\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%;\">Blade length: 27 3/4\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%;\">Blade width at base: 2\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%;\">Grip: 4\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 95%;\">Weight: 3 lbs 15 oz.&nbsp;</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 95%;\">POB: 3\"</span>",

It is especially interesting, therefore, that a 12<sup>th</sup> century Christian church in Norway should be covered with some of the most intricate knotwork designs still surviving from the Viking era.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Urnes Stave Church is an incredibly unique building for several reasons. It is constructed in an architectural style unique to Norway in which large staves form the load-bearing portion of the structure. Over a thousand of these churches used to exist in Medieval Norway, now there are less than thirty. The Urnes Stave Church represents not only the best-preserved example of one of these churches, but one that has stunning carvings along much of the preserved structure. In addition, the Church was built on the location of much older buildings, and contains decorative carvings that are almost a hundred years older than the rest of the church \u2013 this indicates the previous buildings may have been churches from the era when Christianity arrived in Norway.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The carvings themselves are of a distinctive style, so</span><img class=\"size-full wp-image-28362 alignright\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/thumbnail_urnes-stave-church-carved.jpg\" alt=\"thumbnail_urnes-stave-church-carved\" width=\"550\" height=\"320\"></p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;distinctive that it has become known as the Urnes style. This style appears to have been developed by the or</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">iginal builders, who likely constructed the church on behalf of a wealthy medieval family. Fierce animals flow across the wood, their elongated bodies intertwined, depicting conflict and battle. Scenes depicted may be</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;biblical, or may hold some connection to older features of Norse mythology. The distinctive lines of the Urnes style \u2013 contrasted broad and narrow contours, curving in a seemingly endless flow \u2013 are what sets it apart from other Norse artwork from the same era. It is this Urnes style that has been reproduced on the hilt of Darksword Armory\u2019s Urnes Stave Viking Sword.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Urnes Stave Viking Sword is a Darksword design updated with knotwork inspi</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">red by its namesake.

Like most Viking Swords it falls into the Type X of Oakeshott\u2019s Typology, however using the Petersen Typolog</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">y (the definitive Typology of Viking Swords) the Urnes Staves would fall into the Type U group. Swords in this group are among the most commonly reproduced in the modern era and resemble the \u201ctraditional\u201d Viking Sword with their broad -tipped blades, wide fullers, and highly decorated hilt. Swords such as these would be highly effective slashing weapons, often paired with the wide, round Viking shield that so much of effective Viking combat revolved around.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The blade is</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;tempered and resilient like all of Darksword Armory\u2019s swords \u2013 however, it is the fittings where this sword\u2019s personality truly shines. Bronze fittings, cast using the lost wax process, depict Urnes style knotwork with contrasting broad and narrow lines. The handle itself is similarly carved from Ebony and fitted to the tang with epoxy before the pommel is hot peened. This method of construction results in Darksword Armory\u2019s famous durability. The Urnes Stave Viking Sword is a stunning example of a&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">modern Viking reproduction, and is inspired by one of the most beautiful buildings in Norway.

Named for the 12<sup>th</sup>-century church which inspired its knotwork designs, this one-handed Viking Sword is a battle-ready weapon. The Urnes Staves Viking Sword is a hand forged, modern take on a classic, 10-11th century Viking weapon. Like many historical Viking Swords the blade is rigid, wide, and deeply fullered, allowing it to be an extremely effective cutting and slashing weapon. The Ebony handle is carved with knotwork from its namesake church, and the bronze fittings bear the same delicate designs. The Urnes Staves Viking Sword is Darksword\u2019s latest Viking Sword, and is both beautiful and functional.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">More information on the Urnes Staves Viking Sword and the history of the world in which it originated can be found below.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Specs</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-53943\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Warranty-Banner-434x800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"207\" height=\"381\">Hand forged from 5160 High Carbon Steel</span>\nFittings: Solid Bronze\nHandle: carved ebony grip\nTotal length: 36\"\nBlade length: 30\"\nBlade width at base: 2.3\"\nWeight: 3 lbs 1 oz.\nPOB: 3\"",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Few tales of historical conflicts have stirred the imagine, have sparked patriotic fervour, or have galvanised the underdog within us all as the Battle of Thermopylae.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In the early 5th century BC Xerxes the Great, ruler of the Persian Empire, began his rule and set out to conquer all Greece. The Persian army at the time was purportedly one million fighting men, an unheard-of amount of soldiers, who would surely roll through defences and crush resistance by lesser, decentralised forces (scholars dispute the one million number, but agree that the Persian force was vast by ancient standards). The woefully outnumbered Greeks met the Persians at the Pass of Thermopylae, and though they were brave warriors from an age of heroes they could not turn the tide. Finally the armies of the Greeks retreated, leaving behind a small rearguard led by King Leonidas of Sparta and his chosen 300. What followed was a last stand that almost defies description.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Leonidas was King of Sparta when the Persian invasion began, and like the descendant of Heracles ought he went to the Oracle at Delphi to seek counsel. The prophecy he received stated that the lands in which they lived would either be sacked by the Persians, or mourn the death of a King. Believing that he went to his death Leonidas selected only men with living sons, numbering 300, to join him. These 300 men, along with a contingent of Thespians, held the narrow way known as \u201cThe Hot Gates\u201d against the Persian army. Before King Leonidas and the last Spartan died on the third day more than 20,000 Persians had been killed and the bulk of the Greek army had escaped. This action allowed the Greeks breathing room to regroup, and a year later the combined forces of the Greek city-states routed the Persian army and sent them limping back to Persia.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Due to the epic nature of the battle (and the epic nature of the one-liners exchanged by the Persian and Spartan forces \u2013 when asked to surrender their weapons, Leonidas replied \u201cCome and get them\u201d), the tale of Leonidas and his 300 has sparked films, books, comics, songs, and video games. One of the most famous of these is Frank Miller\u2019s 1998 graphic novel, 300, which was inspired by the 1962 film The 300 Spartans. Miller wrote this award-winning series in five issues that would eventually be adapted in the 2006 Zack Snyder film of the same name. The graphic novel (and the film itself) take considerable liberties with the story, though artistic license excuses much \u2013 this retelling of the story is considered the definitive version for this generation.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">One area in which the comic series and film take these liberties is in the costumes of the Spartan warriors. Unlike their historical counterparts, these fictional Spartans fight without body armor or the leather skirts that were standard issue, instead fighting in codpieces, capes, and helmets. The helmet too was drawn more streamlined and altered from the historical version, and appears quite fierce when worn by the Spartan warriors on screen.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Darksword Armory\u2019s Spartan helmet is part of our Herald series, and is imported from an overseas forge. The helmet is made from Mild Steel and is lined with cotton padding, and has the distinctive sharp crest that marked the Spartans apart from the other Greeks in the graphic novel. While this helmet would be wearable for some head sizes for cosplay or Renaissance Faire, it is not constructed for use in simulated combat \u2013 ideally, this would be a display piece for fans of Miller\u2019s graphic novel or Snyder\u2019s film. The Darksword Armory Spartan Helm is our tribute to this generation\u2019s definitive retelling of history\u2019s greatest last stand.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Currently, Darksword Armory has no plans to recreate the Spartan codpiece.</span>",

    "content": "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">16th Century Armor</span></em></h1>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Creatures evolve in response to the dangers in their environment. Beasts evolve claws with which to defend themselves, birds evolved wings in order to escape predators, and insects evolved hardy carapaces to protect themselves from assault. This is also true for human beings, though we humans have the ability to utilize technology to create protection for ourselves. The advancement of this technology \u2013 the development of different forms of body armor throughout the ages \u2013 can be seen as a type of evolution; the adaptation of humankind to new dangers and new weapons developed by their enemies.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Plate armor was one such adaptation. Previous forms of body armor involved either interlocking rings (i.e. chainmail), hardened leather, or small metal plates sewn or riveted into leather coats (known as brigandine armor). Early forms of these armors existed as far back as 500 BCE, and gradually developed into more and more complex and protective forms \u2013 the famous Roman segmented armor involved overlapping strips of protective metals protecting the torso. These adaptations occurred as a result of improving weaponry \u2013 better steel and hardening techniques meant weapons could split rings and cut through hardened leather with ease, and few forms of armor offered any defense against bludgeoning weapons such as warhammers. In order to provide adequate protection against these advancements, plate armor \u2013 armor made from iron or steel plates \u2013 began to appear during the late Middle Ages. While at first these were a series of plates over chainmail, eventually becoming the full suit of plate mail popularized by the mounted knights of medieval history and myth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Full plate armor provided fortification against most medieval weapons \u2013 swords were almost completely ineffective, as were most slashing or piercing weapons, and the damage from blunt weapon impacts was reduced. Full plate continued to evolve and become more effective, eventually advancing to the famous, highly stylized Gothic plate. As much as these new forms of armor were effective, they were also short-lived - by the 16<sup>th</sup> century, the full Gothic plate used in the Great Wars of Italy had begun to fall out of common usage, again due to the evolution of arms. Pikes and narrower sword blades exploited the weak points in the joints of full plate, and the advent of firearms (which could pierce plate mail) began a sharp decline in the efficacy of this mode of protection. Full suits were abandoned in favor of breast-and -back plates, allowing for greater mobility for troops, and the \u201cknight in shining armor\u201d slowly faded into the past. Half plate and three quarters plate became the norm until eventually being phased out in later years.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">This particular set is based on existing examples of Italian three quarters (3/4) plate, also known as munitions armor. Constructed at our partnered forge in India as an example of their craftsmanship, it is constructed from 18g carbon steel and is fully wearable. The helmet is padded with leather and is as wearable as the rest of the suit. Like many similar artifacts of Italian make it is articulated, allowing for a wide range of motion \u2013 the cuisse (leg guards) alone are articulated in 15 pieces. While the armor can be worn it will likely be most sought after as an exhibition piece, and as such it comes with a stand for ease of display. While suits of armor like this are no longer needed, this piece serves as a stunning example of human ingenuity and a sober reminder of the evolution of warfare.</span>",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Medieval history of Germany is rooted in the old Romana Empire. Settled by Germanic tribes, portions of the Roman Empire became the provinces of different Germanic groups until eventually being united under the Frankish Empire in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> centuries. This empire was the largest post-Roman kingdom in Western Europe and existed until it was divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843 AD. The divided empire was created only two generations after the death of Charlemagne the Great and resulted in three successor-states, one of which was East Francia \u2013 later to be called the Kingdom of Germany. Largely a division of language, the German-speaking \u201cEast Franks\u201d would go on to develop a Medieval culture that was very distinct both from the other Frankish kingdoms and from the surrounding areas.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">One of these distinctions was in their arms and armor. While advances in the weapons and protective gear tended to spread across Europe at a rapid pace, individual areas would often settle on certain stylistic or functional designs. The sallet developed in the 15<sup>th</sup> century as a replacement for the open-faced or visored bascinet of the early-to-mid Middle Ages. The bascinet, while suitable protection against the weapons of the middle ages, suffered from restricted mobility and (when paired with a visor) extremely poor vision. The sallet solved both of these problems, being a helm that improved field of vision and range of motion while simultaneously retaining protection for the head, face, and neck. The sallet was used all across Europe but became so widely used in Medieval Germany that it later became known as the \u201cGerman Sallet.\u201d</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Darksword Armory\u2019s German Sallet is an exacting replica of the famous 15<sup>th</sup>-century design. Constructed of 18 gauge mild steel and padded with leather, its smooth curves and crisp lines greatly resemble surviving historical artifacts of this type. A fully articulated visor (bevor) can drop to protect the face, while a scalloped gorget \u2013 another development over the earlier bascinet \u2013 protects the throat. A spring pin holds the bevor in place when it is lowered, ensuring the visor will not flip up at an inopportune moment during combat. The Darksword Armory German Sallet is an exquisite display piece that will surely be an excellent center of attention in your collection.</span>",

Durant son r\u00e8gne, Henry V devenu l\u2019un des monarques d\u2019Angleterre les plus importants pour plusieurs raisons, parmi celles-ci il y\u2019a le nombre de ses victoires lors de la Guerre de Cent ans. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa mort provoqu\u00e9 par la dysenterie, il \u00e9tait reconnu comme \u00e9tant un puissant guerrier et un tacticien militaire brillant \u2013 qui combattu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 14 ans et mena une arm\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 16 ans. Malgr\u00e9 la longue liste de ses succ\u00e8s, Henry V est surtout connu pour ses tactiques militaires in\u00e9galables lors de la bataille d\u2019Agincourt, largement en sous nombre et affam\u00e9s, les forces anglaises ont vaincu les forces fran\u00e7aises presque enti\u00e8rement gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie militaire du jeune Roi. L\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e d\u2019Henry V, labellis\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant de type XVIII.1 par Ewart Oakeshott, \u00e9tait apparemment \u00ab&nbsp;accroch\u00e9e au dessus de la chambre d\u2019Henry V jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle tomba ou bien que quelqu\u2019un la d\u00e9crocha pour l\u2019enfermer dans un vieux coffre.&nbsp;\u00bb Lorsque Ewart Oakeshott \u00e9tudia l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e m\u00e9di\u00e9vale d\u2019Henry V, il en fit cette description \u00ab&nbsp; La quintessence des armes de combat&nbsp;\u00bb et \u00ab&nbsp; L\u2019une des plus belles \u00e9p\u00e9es m\u00e9di\u00e9vales que j\u2019ai eu la chance de tenir entre les mains.&nbsp;\u00bb</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Oakeshott d\u00e9crit l\u2019arme comme \u00e9tant gracieuse avec une pointe aigu. \u00ab&nbsp;Les deux&nbsp;\u00bb c\u00f4t\u00e9s de la lame se rejoignent au bout d\u2019une croix et d\u2019un diamant, comme c\u2019est souvent le cas avec les \u00e9p\u00e9es M\u00e9di\u00e9vales types XVIII. La pointe en c\u00f4ne permet de transformer le r\u00f4le habituel de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e qui est de hacher et trancher en un r\u00f4le lui permettant \u00e9galement de transpercer et de couper. Fin 14<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle, les armures en plaques firent leur apparition et il fallait de nouvelles \u00e9p\u00e9es pour contrecarrer cette innovation. Le design de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e d\u2019Henry V, du fait de sa g\u00e9om\u00e9trie, fait d\u2019elle l\u2019une des \u00e9p\u00e9es les plus int\u00e9ressantes \u00e0 manier. Parfaitement \u00e9quilibr\u00e9, r\u00e9active, puissante et l\u00e9g\u00e8re, l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e d\u2019Henry V est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l\u2019une des meilleurs \u00e9p\u00e9es con\u00e7ues de la fin de la p\u00e9riode m\u00e9di\u00e9vale. Plus tard dans ses \u00e9crits, Oakeshott d\u00e9crit l\u2019arme comme \u00ab&nbsp; Ce n\u2019est pas un objet fun\u00e9raire, mais une magnifique \u00e9p\u00e9e de combat qui prend vie lorsque mani\u00e9e&nbsp;\u00bb.

Alors que l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e a le traditionnel pommeau Normand en forme de roue, la garde, elle est de nature inspir\u00e9e plus qu\u2019historique, ce qui lui donne l\u2019aspect caract\u00e9ristique et l\u2019essence des armes m\u00e9di\u00e9vales.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Notre inspiration pour cette pi\u00e8ce, fut la saga Waylander de David Gemmell, un conte m\u00e9langeant magie, batailles et vengeances.

Une meute de loups \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sentative de la force, la loyaut\u00e9 et \u00e0 la fois un rappel du destin et la&nbsp; mortalit\u00e9 des hommes. A travers tout le monde Nordique, vous aurez du mal \u00e0 trouver un meilleur symbole de royaut\u00e9 et de puissance que cette cr\u00e9ature gracieuse et mortelle. Le loup, et la meute de loups, figurent \u00e9norm\u00e9ment dans les sagas islandaises et autres contes de l\u2019histoire de l\u2019Homme. Les loups sont connus pour \u00eatre des animaux sociaux. Leur plus grande force n\u2019est pas leur vitesse, leurs griffes ou leur crocs mais leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler ensemble afin de faire tomber les plus grands ennemis. C\u2019est cette mentalit\u00e9 de meute qui les d\u00e9finis et qui a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 captiver l\u2019imagination de nombreuses cultures \u00e0 travers le monde pendant des si\u00e8cles.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">C\u2019est pour cela que le concept de \u00ab&nbsp;loup solitaire&nbsp;\u00bb est \u00e0 la fois fascinant et \u00e9mouvant. Un loup solitaire a peut \u00eatre perdu sa meute, ou bien a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 derri\u00e8re ou exclu \u2013 mais il pers\u00e9v\u00e8re. Courant sous la lumi\u00e8re de la lune, se battant pour survivre, refusant de s\u2019abandonner dans la solitude ou le d\u00e9sespoir. Le loup solitaire, bien que rare dans la nature, est devenu le symbole pour ceux qui se sentent \u00ab&nbsp;en dehors&nbsp;\u00bb - de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, de la famille, ou des normes sociales qui les restreignent.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Eindride est une \u00e9p\u00e9e pour le loup solitaire, le vagabond, le paria. Quelqu\u2019un qui, pendant un moment est s\u00e9par\u00e9 de la meute. La garde en bronze de cette \u00e9p\u00e9e pr\u00e9sente des t\u00eates de loups hargneuses, elles sont mises en valeurs par l\u2019art traditionnel d\u2019entrelacement. Un pommeau en bronze ainsi qu\u2019un manche en bois viennent rajouter de la splendeur \u00e0 sa garde. La Lame a un ricasso \u00e9pais au bout duquel on y trouve une lame \u00e0 double tranchant pr\u00e9sentant des runes nordiques signifiant \u00ab&nbsp;Laisse mon \u00e9p\u00e9e \u00eatre ton dernier avertissement&nbsp;\u00bb - Un rugissement provenant du c\u0153ur indomptable du loup solitaire.

    "content": "<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Many modern fans of Norse culture are quick to point out that, contrary to popular belief, not all Norsemen were brutal warriors. According to many amateur and actual historians the pop culture depictions of Vikings as thugs are inaccurate, misleading, and borderline offensive. The Norse were a noble people with a culture rich in art and tradition, not bloodthirsty killers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Then there is Eric Bloodaxe.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The full tale of Eric Haraldsson is a convoluted tale. Much of what we know comes from the Viking sagas composed centuries after his death, and the contemporary accounts of his life are mixed and conflicting. Even the origins of his nickname \u2013 \u201cThe Bloodaxe\u201d are uncertain \u2013 was he named so because of his victories in Viking raids? Or due to the murders he committed against his family?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Born in 885 CE, Eric was favoured son of King Harald Finehair of Norway. Which was fortunate, as Eric reportedly murdered most of his brothers during his rise to power. According to the sagas, Eric was so fearsome a warrior that by the age of 12 he was given several ships and embarked on a series of Viking raids and pirating expeditions, raiding as far away as Wales, Italy, and northern Russia. As he grew older and was marked to succeed his father the strife with his brothers reached a fever-pitch. Numerous bloody battles were fought until Eric emerged as one of the only surviving members of his family; when Harald died in 930 CE Eric succeeded him as king \u2013 for a time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">By some of the reports available we can infer Eric Bloodaxe\u2019s rule was harsh, despotic, and wildly unpopular with his nobles and his people alike. Thus, when his younger half brother Haakon (known as \u201cHaakon the Good,\u201d a sharp contrast with his elder brother) returned from being fostered in England there was a brief but likely memorable coup resulting in Eric fleeing to England and Haakon ascending the throne sometime in late 933, early 934 CE.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Apparently impressing the English king Athelstan, Eric was granted the rule of Northumbria, a notoriously difficult area to rule. This is according to the Sagas, however \u2013 some English sources suggest this was a hostile takeover. Due to political turmoil (and possibly his legendary temper) Eric\u2019s rule was a time of strife in the kingdom. He reigned for two separate periods (947\u2013948 CE, 952\u2013954 CE) before his life was ended by betrayal. In 954 CE Eric was fleeing Northumbria after his latest attempt to successfully rule fell to pieces. One of Eric\u2019s officials and companions, a man named Osulf, reportedly conspired with the warrior Maccus, and Eric Bloodaxe was ambushed and killed in the mountains of north west England. Despite this ignoble end (and a convoluted and disputed history), Eric Bloodaxe remains one of the more popular characters from Viking lore.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">This latest axe by Darksword Armory is an homage to the legend and character of Eric Bloodaxe. The head is of a common variety often see in Viking artwork and surviving artifacts, with a long cutting edge and a dropped back point. The reverse of the head is a solid, chisel-shaped hammer, ensuring that regardless of which side is used to strike the axe will be devastatingly effective. The metal is blackened to reduce the dangers of rust, and the long wooden shaft is wrapped in leather strips to give it a savage, battle-worn appearance. This axe is a highly effective and beautiful piece from Darksword Armory, and we invite you to add it to your collection \u2013 though we ask that it not be used to live up to the name of Eric Haraldsson.</span>",

While the majority of our swords are based on historical models (and whenever possible, models that we have personally examined), others come from books, from myth, and from television or film. These fantasy swords are sometimes more directly based on a popular design (such as our Excalibur sword, inspired by the 1981 film); at other times, our designers are inspired to come up with an original design based on a fantasy weapon or character. </span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">This is how the Mother of Dragons was born.</span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">In George R.R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire (immortalized on television in the HBO series Game of Thrones), the character of Daenerys is at the center of the story. Descended from the Targaryens, a family who long ago controlled dragons in order to unite the Seven Kingdoms, Daenerys begins her journey in the books as an exiled princess being given in marriage to a barbarian warlord. Dragons have long been gone from the world, but Daenerys comes into possession of three dragon eggs \u2013 and unexpectedly is able to hatch them. With the power of her draconic \u201cchildren,\u201d she becomes a major player in a series of epic wars and changes the course of history. Arguably, she is the single most important character in the series.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The overall design of the Mother of Dragons was based on a very unique historical piece. The Wallace Collection, a museum of art, arms, and armor in London, England, contains numerous surviving swords from different periods in European history. The sword in question (pictured below) is unlike any other in the collection, or in any other collection in London. When Darksword Armory founder Eyal Azard saw it he immediately chose it as the physical inspiration for the sword of Daenerys. Subtle changes were made to the design to bring it more closely in line with the vision Eyal had for the Mother of Dragons sword.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The Darksword Armory Mother of Dragons sword is inspired by this character. While in the series Queen Daenerys rarely wields a weapon herself, this sword is designed after what she might have wielded as the mother of the only dragons in existence. The blade is short and broad at the base, and its hollow-ground length tapers to a sharp point. This blade construction combined with the larger pommel brings the point of balance right to the guard, creating a sword that is shockingly lively in the hand and suitable for an individual who may be smaller and more suited to speed over strength. The cast bronze guard depicts a curling dragon that protects the hand, and the matching pommel has a high-born, aristocratic feel. The handle of textured ebony wood completes the look of a sword worthy of a queen, even a queen who relies not on the strength of her arm but on the might of her spirit. We hope it will appeal to others who embody her fierce and powerful spirit.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IllDMZ7T_Is\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">\u201cI will take what is mine with fire and blood.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">\u2014 Daenerys Targaryen</span></p>\n[gallery ids=\"30914,30915,30916\"]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Specifications:</span></strong>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Hand forged from 5160 High Carbon Steel</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Differential Hardened at a Rockwell of 60 at the Edge; 48-50 at the core.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Fittings: Solid Bronze</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Handle: Textured Ebony Grip</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Total length: 26.5\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade length: 20\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade width at base: 2.1\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Weight: 2 lbs 9 oz.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">POB: at crossguard</span>",

For one, it had an almost unheard-of longevity \u2013 the Republic existed as a political and for over a thousand years, from the 7<sup>th</sup> to the 18<sup>th</sup> centuries, when many other nations rose, fell, and faded to obscurity. For another, it had a unique governing structure; whereas many nations during its thousand-year existence were ruled by monarchies of varying levels of control and influence, the Republic was overseen by the Great Council of Venice. This parliament was composed of a hereditary ruling class of powerful merchants and aristocrats who together created laws, elected the Council of Ten (the leaders of the city-state), and the elected the head of state \u2013 the individual known as the Doge of Venice.</span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The Doge (generally translated as \u201cDuke\u201d) was not, unlike most positions of power in Europe at the time, a hereditary office. The Doge was elected for life, it was true, but was forbidden from choosing a successor \u2013 this eliminated the possibility of the office becoming a monarchy. The position was not one that provided great wealth or influence; in fact, the Doge was prevented from owning any foreign land, and after the Doge\u2019s death his family was liable for any crimes he had committed in office (presumably as a method of inspiring honesty and integrity). In later years the power of the Doge declined, and though it became a largely symbolic office there were still benefits to ruling Venice \u2013 one of which was the ability to live in the Doge\u2019s Palace.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The Doge\u2019s Palace (<em>Pa\u0142aso Dogal</em> in Venetian) is an excellent example of Venice\u2019s take on Gothic architecture. While several iterations of the Palace existed through the years (rebuilt due to age, changes in government, and several notable fires), most of the current structure was completed in the 15<sup>th</sup> century. After the end of the office of the Doge in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, the Palace remained in use by various branches of government for the next century. In 1923 the last public office was removed from the building, and the restored Doge Palace entered its next stage of existence as a museum. The museum, in addition to its breathtaking construction and frescos, contains numerous works of art and artifacts from Venice\u2019s history \u2013 including a breathtaking collection of medieval and renaissance swords.</span>\n\n[gallery ids=\"31216,31217,31218\"]\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The Darksword Armory Doge Museum Sword is based on surviving examples with the Doge museum. Its curved guard with finger protector is common on swords form this area of Europe, and the distinctive-shaped pommel sets it apart from other medieval and renaissance swords. Travelers to Venice will recognize this unique pommel and guard combination from several swords in the Doge collection. The blade chosen for this particular representation is hollow ground with a stiff spine, allowing for good flexibility but retaining the ability to make a firm thrust. The blade\u2019s long, tapering point is common among many blades of the 15<sup>th</sup> century, which were adapted to thrust into the gaps of full plate armor. An oxblood leather wrapped handle completes the weapon, which would certainly look at home on the hip of any Venetian who walked the streets of one of the longest-lasting republics in history.</span>",

And it\u2019s true \u2013 Oakeshott literally wrote the book on medieval sword types, and a whole system of classification (The Oakeshott Typology) is named after him. More advanced collectors may recognize the names Dr. Jan Peterson (1887-1967), who created a typology for classifying Viking swords, or Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (1890-1976), who refined Peterson\u2019s typology. Predating any of these scholars, however, is a man whose writing on medieval arms, armor, and architecture dwarfs many later historians\u2019 bibliographies \u2013 though he is largely unrecognized by the modern sword collecting world.</span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc was born in 1814 in Paris, France. He was an architect by trade, a brilliant one by all accounts, and an inspired artist and illustrator. While the architectural world knows Viollet-le-Duc as an architect, restorer of historical buildings and monuments (including considerable work on Notre-Dame Cathedral and many other famous landmarks), and as the first true theorist of modern architecture, he also wrote and illustrated some of the largest volumes in existence on the medieval sword.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The volumes Viollet-le-Duc wrote are breathtaking in their scope and depth. His extensive writings cover not only descriptions of different medieval swords and armor but tracks and explains their evolution throughout history, and his stunning illustrations compliment his writing expertly. Unfortunately, as his works were not commonly translated into English, the largely-anglophone sword collecting population remains ignorant of these incredible volumes and Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s influence on medieval scholarship. Some translations exist, but copies are notoriously hard to find and prohibitively expensive.&nbsp; In the English-speaking world, many of these works and completely unknown, and the incredible scholarship they contain can only be found by efforts of French-speaking individuals - such as us here at Darksword Armory.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">The Duke sword is inspired by an illustration in Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc medieval encyclopedia, a masterwork of exposition and illustration. A classic knightly sword, the Duke is designed to resemble the cruciform arming sword so often found in medieval art. The straight guard is expertly sculpted and subtle in its smooth lines. A double-edged, single-fullered blade departs slightly from Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s illustration in that it has a less severe taper and termination. The pommel may appear to be a standard wheel-style pommel with peen block, but has in fact been made slightly oversized to counterbalance the blade. This brings the point-of-balance closer to the guard, resulting in a sword that is startlingly lively in the hand and that flows effortlessly from strike to guard. The Duke is one of our best attempts at recreating the knight\u2019s arming sword, and we hope the great Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc would be proud of us.</span>",

Typically, armors dating prior to the 13th century were mainly composed of mail armor, or maille, made to counter the impact of the uniform sword blades of the early medieval period. By the mid-13th century however, the armies of Feudal Europe witnessed not only an increase in plated armour but consequently, witnessed a change in blade geometry. Finely tapered blades, with very pointy tips now served to pierce through ever-increasing plate armor of the military elite.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">This is an interesting example of the transitional medieval swords used during the outset of the 13th century. Crowned with a \u201ccocked-hat\u201d pommel, originally found in Scandinavia, this sword hilt was generally mounted on a type X or type XII blade.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The type X was in common usage from the time of the Vikings throughout much of the medieval age, and is recognizable for its broad blade with full-length fuller. By contrast, the type XII had a shortened fuller and a more tapered cross-section, resulting in both improved handling and increased utility in piercing the armor of the High Middle Ages. Thus, the XII was a cut-and-thrust sword that evolved from previous incarnations of the medieval sword.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The \u201ccocked-hat\u201d pommel, classified by Petersen as Type Y, was used through the 11th and 12th centuries. By the 13th century the \u201ccoked-hat\u201d pommel remained in use, but became more massive. Numerous examples are found throughout Europe. During his examinations of various swords of the middle ages, Oakeshott noted identical swords in various sources; from a crucifixion scene in a 13th century manuscript from Goslar, a sword found in Hungary with an identical pommel, another identical sword from Brunau, An example found in a German manuscript and a final example at the end of the 13th century on the grave-slab of Ulrich von Regensburg in Zurich.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Darksword Armory Earl Sword is a true representation of a classic 13th century medieval sword. A straight guard married to a cocked-hat pommel identifies it as a later example of a medieval sword - sketches of these hilts are visible in Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc's Medival Encyclopedia. The short fuller and tapered blade is indicative of the Oakeshott type XII, and gives the sword its lively presence in the hand. A leather wrapped handle hides a robust tang, also a hallmark of the cut-and-thrust swords of the 13th century and later periods. For a timeless medieval knightly sword with excellent handling, classic fittings, and a distinctive pommel, the Darksword Armory Earl sword will serve you well.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qizhOyXj8e8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></center><center><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-50489\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1314-the-earl-medieval-sword-mid-13th-century-sword-darksword-armory.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1427\" height=\"1435\"></center>\n&nbsp;",

Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, its edge was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it And\u00faril, Flame of the West.\u201d</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">\u2015 J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In 1937, a British First World War veteran and college professor named John Ronald Reuel Tolkien quietly published an unusual book. The book was entitled, \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d and was the sort of story that \u2013 unexpectedly to its author \u2013 gripped the imagination of every generation since. The Hobbit was the first of Tolkien\u2019s books set in the land of Middle-earth, a fictionalized version of Europe\u2019s long distant past. The most famous of these books was The Lord of the Rings, a three-part epic high fantasy novel that was absolutely formative for the fantasy genre and the subject of inspiration (if not outright plagiarism) for every author that came afterward. Films and stage productions have been made of his works, college and universities teach courses and seminars about the meaning of his books \u2013 were they pure fiction? Or political allegory?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In letters written later in his life, Tolkien admitted that his books were not (as was the popular understanding) an allegory for the Second World War, or even for the First World War in which he served and lost all but one of his childhood friends. Instead, his books were intended to be a modern take on the classic faerie story \u2013 a tale that would have not only internal consistency but outward applicability in any age. Perhaps this is why the stories continue to give inspiration and meaning to people born many decades since they were originally written \u2013 a fact that would please Tolkien greatly. And as a faerie story, there are many examples of strange and magical weapons in the pages of The Lord of the Rings \u2013 none are more famous than Anduril.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In order to understand the importance of the Anduril sword, one must first understand its position in the history of Middle-earth. During a time known as the Second Age there was a great island kingdom called N\u00famenor, whose kings were descendants of a union of Humans and Elves. This mighty race of explorers grew powerful, and prideful in their power, so much so that they sought even to challenge the gods. This was to be their downfall, and the island of N\u00famenor was sunk beneath the ocean in a terrible cataclysm. The surviving few, a faithful remnant of N\u00famenor, travelled to the mainland and founded the kingdoms-in-exile of Gondor and Arnor. The ruler of these kingdoms was Elendil, High King, and out of the ruins of N\u00famenor he carried with him the ancient sword Narsil \u2013 an heirloom from the first king of the N\u00famenoreans.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">War came to Middle-earth, and Elendil raised up his people to march along side the Elves and their King, Gil-galad. The Last Alliance brought their might against the forces of Mordor and the Dark Lord Sauron, who wielded the terrible power of the One Ring against them. Forced to face Sauron himself in single combat, the sword Narsil was broken and Eldendil was slain. Isildur, the heir of Elendil, took up the broken shard of Narsil and cut the One Ring from Sauron\u2019s hand, ending his terrible reign over the free peoples of Middle-earth. The shards of Narsil were passed down in the family, even after the House of Elendil fell into decay and they were Kings no longer.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">When the events of the first book of The Lord of the Rings begin, the One Ring (thought lost to time for centuries) has been found, and the scattered remnants of the people of Middle-earth must rally for another war. A distant descendant of Elendil \u2013 the ranger Aragorn, not a king but a wanderer in the wilderness \u2013 must take up both the cause of his ancestors and the blade to defeat Sauron once and for all. The shards of Narsil are reforged by the Elves, and into Aragorn\u2019s hands is given a new sword \u2013 Anduril, the Flame of the West. Aragorn rises to lead Middle-earth, Anduril in hand, and bring them out of the shadow and into a future free from Sauron\u2019s tyranny as the new king of Gondor. Anduril is at the center of this mythological story arc, as depicted in the poem Tolkien wrote about the hero Aragorn\u2019s journey:</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">All that is gold does not glitter,</span></em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Not all those who wander are lost;</span></em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The old that is strong does not wither,</span></em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Deep roots are not reached by the frost.</span></em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">From the ashes a fire shall be woken,</span></em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">A light from the shadows shall spring;</span></em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Renewed shall be blade that was broken,</span></em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The crownless again shall be king.</span></em></span>\n\n-J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nAs fans of Tolkien\u2019s incredible works, we at Darksword Armory are pleased to recreate the sword of the King of Gondor. The Darksword Armory Anduril is hand Crafted with 5160 High Carbon steel, dual hardened to a Rockwell of 60 at the edge and 48-50 at the core. The beautifully detailed leather handle is accentuated by the unique pommel, making this one of the most recognized fantasy swords. The blade is forged with a deep full length fuller. The Anduril sword, as with all our swords, is a powerful battle ready sword, capable of delivering considerable damage with a two-handed swing. Given the pommel geometry, the Anduril sword was not topped with a peened pommel but rather hot peened. That being said, the pommel and tang were heated and pressure set. This is a favorite among fantasy sword collectors, and for good reason. We are proud to contribute even in a small way to the appreciation of the work of a literary master such as Tolkien.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

Tolkien and the films based on his stories. The Ranger Sword is hand Crafted with 5160 High Carbon steel, dual hardened to Rockwell of 60 at cutting edge and 48-50 at the core. As with all our battle ready swords, the tang is peened over the pommel. The beautifully detailed leather handle is accentuated by the unique pommel, making this one of the most recognized fantasy swords. The blade is forged with a deep full length fuller.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The D\u00fanedain Rangers are pivotal characters in the world of Middle Earth. Many centuries before the start of the Lord of the Rings series there was the great island kingdom of Numenor. The rulers of this kingdom were the human descendants of the half-elven Elros, a great lord and powerful foe of evil. The island kingdom was raised to be the stronghold of Elros\u2019 people, and for many years his descendants kept peace and were faithful followers of the Valar, the holy rulers of Middle Earth. They had great power and freedom, only forbidden one thing \u2013 to never sail into the west, and set foot on sacred Valinor. As the kingdom waxed in wealth and its rulers waned in wisdom they sought to challenge even the Valar, and set sail with a mighty fleet to Valinor. This fleet was utterly destroyed, and the island kingdom sundered and plunged beneath the waves. Only a small remnant was saved.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">This remnant became the Middle Earth kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor and were ruled over by Elendil and his heirs. However, some of the surviving Numenoreans left these kingdoms and travelled to the north. There, they dedicated themselves to the eradication of evil and the defense of the free peoples of Middle Earth. They became known as the D\u00fanedain Rangers, and despite their efforts were widely distrusted by the folk who lived in these lands. Their thankless tasks unnoticed, they nevertheless fought tirelessly against overwhelming odds. None of these Rangers were anything less than heroes, and none of them more famous than the one they called Strider.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Based on the sword of Strider the Ranger from the Lord of the Rings, the Ranger Sword is one of our best sellers. Made with Darksword Armory\u2019s usual attention to detail and sturdy construction, this two handed sword is an epic weapon to use against the forces of darkness.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Ranger Sword is a hefty inspirational two handed sword. The broad long blade delivers lethal, powerful blows aided by it's weight. The Ranger sword, at 4 lbs 11 oz, is by far our heaviest battle ready sword, mainly deriving from the large pommel and guard. Despite it's weight, the sword is well balanced, responsive and rugged. In a nutshell, the Ranger sword is reliable and virtually indestructible!</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6X_aRw7oQg\" width=\"660\" height=\"415\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></center>\n&nbsp;\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Folded Steel.

    "content": "The Spartan Sword\nInspirational, Ancient Greek Sword\n\nThe tale of \u201cLeonidas and his brave 300\u201d has inspired many works of fiction, including poems and in recent years films and novels. One of the most famous is the 1998 graphic novel \u201c300\u201d by Frank Miller. This work featured a unique artistic style that was adopted into a 2007 film by the same name. The battle ready swords used by the Spartans in the film is not historically based but still has managed to become an extremely popular among purveyors of fine quality swords. The Spartan sword is short and single edged. Narrow at the shoulders and widening towards the tapered and curved tip. The unique looking curved guard and pommel provide partial hand protection. This blade may not be a historical model, but would be deadly in the hands of any Spartan.\n\nThe Sparta medieval sword is a very slick and maneuverable medieval sword. Perfect for close quarter combat, the battle ready sword can deliver quick cuts and thrusts. The short rigid blade offers an exceptional balance despite the width while the sharp tip can delivers destructive thrusts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDelay note: If we do not have your Elite Series Piece in stock, please expect a wait time of approximately 6-12 months.",

Numerous examples survive in museums and private collections, and virtually all of them are single-handed weapons. And with good reason \u2013 Viking hand-to-hand combat revolved around the shield, typically a wooden circle with steel cladding around the edge and a pointed steel boss. In order for the shield to function properly a single-handed weapon was necessary, and the Viking sword was a natural companion.\n\nViking swords are frequently reproduced by modern makers, and given the multitude of Viking swords on the market one wonders whether the market is saturated. Many reproductions however, play into the stereotype of Viking swords as little more than long cleavers \u2013 heavy, brutish weapons wielded by brutal people. These reproductions fail to capture the spirit or \u201cfunction\u201d of the Viking sword as an important step in the evolution of the European medieval swords, from earlier Romanesque style to the arming swords of the late medieval period. For the most part, Darksword Armory Viking Swords go against the modern trend of producing unbalanced, unwieldy Viking Swords.\n\nThis is what makes the Guardlan Sword so unique. For one, the blade is extended past what the average Viking would wield. The longer blade necessitates the handle being extended, turning the Guardlan into a true two-handed weapon \u2013 unlike the vast majority of Viking swords.&nbsp;\n\nThis is not to say that the Guardlan has no basis in history. The basic design is still within the typical typology of the Viking sword - the most authoritative typology of the Viking swords was the Peterson Typology, written by Dr. Jan Peterson in 1919. Focusing on variations in pommel and guards to formulate a 26 category scheme, Jan Perterson created a typological reference to determine the date of each sub type. The distinct pommel identifies the Guardlan as a Type R, or \u201cFive Lobe\u201d style, one of the most recognizable types of Viking pommels.\n\nThe blade has the distinctive wide fuller and spatulate tip typical of designs from the Viking era, making it a predominantly slashing weapon. While using a Type 4 blade from the Geibig Typology, we fitted the five lobe Viking medieval sword with an extended handle that is long\n\nenough for a comfortable two handed grip. The type 4 blade, found from the mid-tenth century through the mid-eleventh century, features a slight taper and a fuller which extends the blade\u2019s full length. The Guardlan sword is battle ready and features a 30 inch blade, forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel and dual hardened.\n\nWe carefully crafted this Viking medieval sword to reflect the Norse cultural and artistic heritage. Exceptional tools of war, the Viking medieval swords also attest to the Viking culture\u2019s keen interest in art and aesthetic beauty. We hope you can appreciate the work that went into creating this unique piece inspired by the exceptional craftsmen of the Viking era.\n\n&nbsp;",
    "excerpt": "This is a folded steel version of one of our best selling swords....The Guardlan.&nbsp; &nbsp;The blade is forged in the traditional Japanese folded steel method, creating a beautiful and original pattern, created by multiple layers of folded steel.\n\nThe <em>Guardlan</em> Viking Sword is a blend of history and modern design. Taking its inspiration from Norse culture, this battle-ready sword is hand forged and fully functional. A unique two-handed version of a traditional Viking design, the broad blade is significantly longer than our single-handed designs. The extra heft of the sword would be absolutely devastating in battle, capable of broad slashes that could cut down a warrior in his prime \u2013 or sweep an attacker from horseback.\n\nMore information on the Guardlan Viking Sword and the inspiration which led to its creation can be found below\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Folded Steel.\nDual Tempered HRc 60, 48-50 at the core\nFittings : Mild Steel\nTotal Length: 39.5\"\nBlade Length : 30\"\nGrip Length: 8\"\nPOB: 4.5\"\nWeight: 2 lbs 7 oz",

A wolf pack was representative of attributes like strength, loyalty, and a stark reminder of the mortality and doom of man. Across the whole Nordic world you would be hard pressed to find a greater symbol of royalty and power than this most graceful and deadly creature. The wolf, and the wolf pack, feature heavily in the Icelandic sagas and other stories throughout human history. Wolves are known as social animals. Their greatest strength is not their speed, their claws, or their fangs, but their ability to work together to bring down greater foes. It is this pack mentality that defines their being and has captured the imaginations of cultures around the world for centuries.</span></p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">It is also why the \"lone wolf\" concept is so simultaneously fascinating, and heartbreaking. A lone wolf may have lost their pack, or left it behind, or been cast out - but they still persevere. Running in the moonlight, fighting for survival, refusing to give in to loneliness or despair. Lone wolves, while rare in nature, have become symbols for people who feel they are on the \"outside\" - of society, family, or the social norms that constrain them.</span></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Eindride is a sword for the lone wolf, the wanderer, the outcast. Someone who, for a time at least, is separated from their pack. This sword's cast bronze guard features snarling wolf heads on the hilt, accented by traditional knotwork. A simple bronze scentstopper pommel and leather wrapped oak grip complement the elaborate hilt. The blade has a thick ricasso that transitions into a single fuller double edged design that has norse runes inscribed, reading, \"One Who Rides Alone\" - a snarl from the indomitable heart of the lone wolf. The Eindride was designed with these people in mind, in honour of their unbreakable spirits, to be their companion when no one else is. We hope it will keep you safe on the journey.</span></p>\n\n</div>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_24336\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"]<img class=\"wp-image-24336 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/the-eindride-lone-wolf-medieval-sword-bare-blade-full-tang-1545-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"the-eindride-lone-wolf-medieval-sword-bare-blade-full-tang-1545\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"> The Eindride Lone Wolf Sword, prior to assembly.[/caption]",

Italian design.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">It is impossible to read medieval-based historical fiction, or watch medieval-based television and films, without encountering the concept of the tournament. Medieval tournaments, and later events focused on the joust, were a centerpiece of European culture for hundreds of years. Originating in France, tournaments were originally mock battles between groups of (allied) knights, often ending with one \u201cteam\u201d captured by another. These mock battles were called m\u00eal\u00e9e<em>, </em>and their use as training (and, eventually, sport) spread swiftly across the rest of Europe. From the 11<sup>th</sup> century onward, tournaments became a fixture of European culture and martial prowess.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">From the \u201cpell mell\u201d mock battles of the early m\u00eal\u00e9e, the medieval tournament evolved into an event that would make any modern sports fan feel at home. As the Middle Ages continued tournaments became complex, multi-day events involving many different contests of combat skill. Archery, jousting, hand-to-hand combat, knights and nobles would compete with each other for honor and accolades. These tournaments would be complete with food vendors, intermissions with music and entertainment, jugglers and theater, and sellers of horses, weapons, and fine goods. When tournaments began to be attached to major events such as marriages, military victories, holidays, or coronations, they would often involve sumptuous banquets \u2013 sometimes several. And while chivalry was mostly a created fiction, the medieval tournament became a place where that fiction \u2013 in the form of \u201chonorable\u201d combat \u2013 could be acted out in real life.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Most significantly for students of medieval arms and armor, tournaments became a place where the skill of blacksmiths and armorers could be showcased. A knight riding in front of hundreds of adoring fans gets a great deal of attention, and is a perfect canvas on which an armorer could demonstrate their art. Tournament armor became not only eminently functional (as it had to be, lest an eager young knight accidentally impale his lord) but also a thing of beauty \u2013 covered in gold filigree, carved or hammered in intricate designs, and polished to a brilliant shine. Surviving examples of tournament armor exist in museums around the world and are among the most beautiful and skillfully crafted creations of the medieval era.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Commissioned on behalf of Darksword Armory from an experienced forge in India, the Darksword Armory Tournament Armor is our take on those armors made famous by the medieval tournament. Constructed with a \u201cone-size-fits-most\u201d approach, the Tournament Armor is made from 18 gauge steel and would hold up to light use. However, where it truly shines is as a display piece \u2013 similar to armors worn by young knights or minor nobles, it showcases the skill of the artisans who created it. We hope that this armor will find a place of honor in your home.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",
    "excerpt": "<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">New from Darksword Armory, the Tournament Armor hearkens back to the days of tightly regulated, practice combat. Opportunities to display martial prowess, honorable behavior, and win glory for one\u2019s name, the medieval tournament has become an object of fascination for modern collectors. Blurring the lines between medieval reality and chivalric fiction, tournaments were nevertheless dangerous events that required protective equipment. The Darksword Armory Tournament Armor is a set of functional display armor sourced from an external forge and distributed by Darksword Armory, and would be a beautiful addition to any collection or home.</span>",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">For centuries, the deadliest force on the battlefield was the heavy cavalry. Armored knights, high atop heavy horse, rode down their foes with lance in hand. It was terrifyingly effective as a battlefield tactic as the knights were both well-protected and highly mobile, but it required significant skill and training to perform. From the 11<sup>th</sup>-century onward knights would practice diligently on horseback, learning to ride swiftly while armored and strike targets precisely with their long wooden lances. These practice sessions would be against stationary targets and fellow knights alike, and could be almost as dangerous as actual combat. Out of these practice sessions grew the sport of jousting \u2013 adapted from heavy cavalry practice and transformed into a controlled, but still dangerous, contest of strength and skill.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Jousting, as a sport, grew in popularity and complexity throughout the middle ages. Early versions were mere training matches between fellow knights, but as the medieval period continued the joust began to be surrounded by fanfare, markets, feasting, and notions of honor. Nobles and even royalty began to practice the sport, and specialized equipment began to be designed for the event. From the 11<sup>th</sup> to the 14<sup>th</sup> century people came together to observe what was still fairly brutal mock combat \u2013 including knights riding at each other with lances across a field separated only by a low fence (called a <em>tilt</em>, hence <em>tilting</em> as the other name for the sport), and then switching to close-combat weapons on horseback or on foot. As a result, plate armor \u2013 including specially constructed protections for the legs, chest, and face that were designed to reduce the danger of being hit by a wooden lance at high speeds \u2013 were the norm.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">As Europe transitioned into the later middle ages, the medieval concept of chivalry became strongly associated with the joust. The concept was only loosely based on reality \u2013 the \u201cknight errant,\u201d while more of a fictional creation, began nevertheless to influence how knights and the cultural structures surrounding the, developed. Jousts began to high highly regulated, with more rules and expectations of fighting according to the chivalric code. This often meant fighting in such a way that would most likely get you killed in a pitched battle, including not taking advantage of an opponent who stumbled or who suffered an injury. Th arms and armor used in these contests evolved as well, not only being focused on function but with an eye towards form. Jousting armor became an opportunity for armorers to showcase their talent, creating stunning works of art that would be displayed before all in the tournament \u2013 before the individual wearing the beautiful armor was sent flying from their war-horse to land in the mud.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Darksword Armory Late 16<sup>th</sup> Century Jousting Armor is an example of some of the armors that emerged near the end of the jousting era. Specially commissioned by Darksword Armory from a forge in India with a long history of making similar works, this armor is fully articulating for maximum range of motion. Made of 18 gauge steel \u2013 meaning, thick enough to function in mild mock combat, but not as thick as historical jousting armor \u2013 this armor is also subtly decorated, and might resemble the armor worn by a young knight or minor noble just beginning their career. Balancing form and function, this Late 16<sup>th</sup> Century Jousting Armor would make for a beautiful display in any home or collection.</span>",

For over four centuries jousting was a popular sport throughout Europe, and resulted in the development of specialized armor designed to protect participants in this deadly game. This jousting armor, based on surviving examples from the late 16<sup>th</sup>-century, was commissioned at an external forge for distribution by Darksword Armory. Fully functional and articulating, it would be a stunning centerpiece to any collection.</span>",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In 2011, production company and broadcaster HBO embarked on an endeavour that would change the landscape of broadcast television. Drawing from fantasy author George R. R. Martin\u2019s popular <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> book series, the production giant created an epic fantasy series unlike any that had been done before. <em>Game of Thrones</em> quickly became an international phenomenon, breaking records and becoming the \u201cmust-see\u201d series of the decade. Everything about the series was a massive draw for viewers \u2013 the writing, the acting, the directing, the special effects, everything was expertly crafted with no expense spared. It probably didn\u2019t hurt that there were frequent and steamy scenes of intimacy between the beautiful and very in shape members of the cast.&nbsp; Game of Thrones ended in 2019, and with it ended a story that had captured imaginations around the world for its scope, breadth, and depth of mythology.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In the world in which Game of Thrones takes place, the fictional land of Westeros is ruled over by the \u201cKing of the Andals First Men.\u201d This monarch, seated on the <a href=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapon/game-of-thrones/the-iron-throne/\">Iron Throne</a>, reigns over the territories known as the Seven Kingdoms. These kingdoms form a loose alliance of provinces that stretched from the far south all the way to the titanic structure of ice in the North known as The Wall. During the majority of the series, the role of sovereign is held by members of House Lannister, a family known in the series for deceit, betrayal, and unconventional sibling relationships.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The King of the Seven Kingdoms is protected by seven knights known as the Kingsguard, ostensibly the most skilled and courageous knights in the land. Swearing holy oaths, the Kingsguard pledged to never marry, never father children, and never seek wealth or glory of their own, but to dedicate every moment to protecting the King and royal family. These knights were chosen for their prowess in battle and for their unparalleled loyalty \u2013 which is ironic, considering the reigning monarch prior to the start of the series was assassinated by then-Kingsguard Jamie Lannister. This assassination led to the ascension of Robert Baratheon to the Iron Throne and his marriage to Jamie\u2019s twin Cersei. Jamie Lannister remained a member of the Kingsguard, and watched over his sister as House Lannister slowly established its stranglehold over the Seven Kingdoms.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Darksword Armory Game of Thrones armor is inspired by the Kingsguard that protected the ruler on the Iron Throne. The armor these knights wore was gilded, shining even from a distance, and often worn with white cloaks \u2013 hence the name often given to the Kingsguard, \u201cThe White Swords.\u201d The armor featured here has been commissioned by Darksword Armory from an external swords, and is made to our exacting standards from 16 gauge steel with leather accents. Unlike the armor made in house by Darksword, this armor is not battle-ready nor is it customizable \u2013 however, it is still an exquisite piece that would be suitable for cosplay, renaissance fairs, and display. Inspired by the incredible work of George R. R. Martin, the Darksword Armory Game of Thrones Armor is sure to impress friends, family, and anyone who watched the most famous television series of this generation.</span>",

Certainly, though, it is not a small number \u2013 though decay, through carelessness, through the loss of personal collections into estate sales and long term storage many artifacts of bygone days have vanished into obscurity. Finding one of these relics, recovering what was lost with virtually no trail, is incredibly rare \u2013 which is what makes the Alexandria sword, also known as the \u201cHarriet Dean Sword,\u201d so unique.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">In 1414, a peace treaty was brokered between the kingdom of Cyprus and the Sultan of Egypt. After the peace treaty (which ended a long and difficult conflict), the Cyprian King Janus made a gift of several swords to Sultan al-Mu\u00b4ayyad Shaykh. By the report of historians Sultan al-Mu\u00b4ayyad Shaykh was a humble man and a lover of architecture and scholarship, demolishing a prison and commissioning a mosque in its place as well as many religious monuments. The swords he received as a gift from King Janus of Cyprus were sent to the Arsenal at Alexandria, where a sizable collection of medieval arms and armor existed.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">In 1904, medieval armor expert Bashford Dean founded the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Department of Arms and Armor. As a curator of this collection Dean went on numerous trips around the world to purchase relics, both for the Met exhibit and for his personal collection. One such visit brought him into contact with the Alexandria Arsenal in 1919, which even centuries later was in excellent condition due to Egypt\u2019s dry climate. Among the articles that returned with Dean were a matched pair of swords with an Arabic inscription indicating it was a gift of the Sultan to the Arsenal collection. Dean continued to expand both his and the Met\u2019s collection until his untimely death in 1928, at which time one of the matched pair of 15-th century longswords was bequeathed to the Met\u2019s collection (and became known as the \u201cBashford Dean Sword,\u201d while the other went to Dean\u2019s beloved sister Harriet Dean.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Harriet kept the sword until her death in 1943, at which point (like so many other relics of European history) vanished without a trace. For over 70 years the Harriet Dean Sword evaded capture, a white whale for so many curators and historians who hunted it for collections both public and private. The sword was thought lost, and became well known in academic circles despite its absence from the public eye. And lost is where it would have stayed, had an arms-and-armor expert working for an auction house not agreed to view a collection of weapons that was being consigned to an estate sale. There, in a small Texas restaurant, he was astonished to be staring at a picture of the Harriet Dean Sword, the last sword of the Alexandria Arsenal.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">One of Darksword owner and founder's favorite sword, the Alexandria is truly a magnificent sword, honoring the original \"Harriet Dean\" longsword of the 15th Century. &nbsp;Its hallow-ground diamond cross-sectioned blade has a broad base and sharply tapered tip, making it both exquisitely balanced and suitable for splitting links of chain or probing gaps in plate armor. While designed primarily as a thrusting weapon like many renaissance longswords, it would also be highly effective at cutting targets. The leather wrapped oak grip is complimented by a robust tang, and the plain steel fittings and wheel pommel with peen block are typical of the Oakeshott Type XVIIIc. Many of the longsword manuals of that era, such as Fiore Dei Liberi's famous Flos Duellatorum (\u201cThe Flower of Battle\u201d), were written for use with swords such as this.</span>\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLmFudAr-b4\" width=\"860\" height=\"515\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe></center><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Our latest renaissance longsword is an homage to the lost sword of Alexandria, a sword commissioned by a King, gifted to a Sultan, purchased by a curator, inherited by a sister, lost to time, and finally found again by a collector like so many of our customers.

Viking craftsmen excelled in woodworking, metalworking and weapons making with abstracted animal forms. Many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapons/medieval-axes/axes-viking-axes/\">Viking weapons</a>&nbsp;and ships bore elaborate patterns of interlocking anthropomorphic figures. Runic texts and complementary scenes were frequently inscribed on stone. The Viking love of riddling phrases and schemes of rhyme yielded a rich poetic tradition and tales of mythic events.</p>\nThe Vikings are among the most celebrated warriors of human history. Not the least due to their own stories and Sagas of epic battles and heroic deeds. For centuries, the Vikings raided and colonized wide areas of Europe. They reached North America centuries before Columbus and traded as far as modern day India. These Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish warriors were prompted to undertake their raids by a combination of socio-political factors and overpopulation. As a result, Norse culture permeated all of Western Europe and greatly influenced the development of many modern nations.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">At the center of this fierce nomadic culture, stood the Viking sword. No object was praised more among the Vikings than<em>&nbsp;the</em>sword. While other Viking weapons, such as the axe or spear, were important mainstays of Viking martial life, the sword was viewed with special reverence \u2013 not only for its utility in combat, but also due to the incredible skill involved in their construction. Smithing the long, tempered blades with the technology available at the time was tremendously difficult, and the evolution of the Viking sword is a testament to the Viking smiths\u2019 steady growth in expertise.</div>\nThis evolution was first described by Dr Jan Petersen, a Norwegian archaeologist who lived in the late 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and early 20<sup>th</sup>centuries. Petersen studied the development of Viking sword smithing and published his results in his dissertation, \u201cThe Norwegian Viking Swords: A Typological-Chronological Study of Viking Age Weaponry.\u201d This revolutionary typology was the first of its kind, and laid the groundwork for later typologies (such as Ewart Oakeshott\u2019s typology of the medieval sword).\n\nPetersen\u2019s typology traces the ascension of the Viking sword from its humble beginnings \u2013 the Type A, a flat, simple broad blade that existed at the end of the Frankish dynasty known as the Merovingian period and early Viking Age (from roughly 700-800CE). Early Types, such as Types B and C, contain double-edged and single-edged examples. Later examples were primarily double-edged and distinguished mainly by differences in the hilt \u2013 once established, the Viking blade varied little in the later years of the era.\n\nThe Darksword Armory Oslo Viking Sword is based on these later examples, and most closely resembles the Petersen Type D (primarily used from 850-900 AD). Unlike later medieval swords which were used for cut-and-thrust, Viking swords were designed primarily for slashing \u2013 this was to counter the leather armour of the time, which allowed swords to be devastatingly effective on the battlefield. Chain links would part beneath the heavy blows this weapon could inflict, and lesser armored opponents would be helpless against such blades.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n</div>\n<img class=\"wp-image-37072 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5232-2-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\">\n\nLike most Viking swords (which Oakeshott would later lump together under Type X in his typology), the sword has a rugged broad blade of medium length (avg. 31\u2033) with a wide fuller fading at the tip.&nbsp;This transfers much of the weight towards the tip of the blade, producing a high point-of-balance and giving the sword tremendous chopping power.\n\nAs in the later examples of Petersen\u2019s typology, the hilt is the biggest differentiating factor \u2013 and while crafting the solid bronze guard and pommel, the essence of the Viking heritage was carefully honoured. Norse knotwork \u2013 a consistent feature of Viking culture \u2013 is skillfully imbued into the bronze guard using the lost wax process with designs are based on historical examples. The grip is meticulously engraved solid ebony.\n\nSkillfully crafted from 5160 High Carbon steel, the Oslo Viking Sword is an inspiring weapon. Authoritative, vibrant and rugged, the Oslo Viking sword is well balanced and a fierce Viking weapon of choice. &nbsp;Inspired by the remains of a 10th C. Viking hilt with elaborated serpentine motifs, the sword remains faithful to its historical counterparts.\n\nThe sword has always been at the core of Viking history. As a result, we engineered the Oslo Viking sword for the same kind of brutal use that the original historical examples would have been put to. Vivid and resilient, the Oslo Viking sword is built to last.",

A time when Vikings piled into long ships to set out across the seas, raiding and settling the lands they found. But far more than just savage barbarians, they were also farmers, poets, traders, and explorers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Their stories can be found in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://naturalhistory.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/sagas.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vinland Sagas</a>. Part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sagadb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Icelandic Sagas</a>, and evoking the legendary names of Einar and Erik the Red, the Vinland Sagas represent the most complete information about the Norse exploration of the Americas and paint a vivid portrait of a heroic world long lost and the amazing people who inhabited it. The Vinland sagas originate from the same land as Njal and Gunnar, as told in Njal\u2019s Saga, two friends whose families\u2019 unending feud would bring them to a violent end. As the tragedy of Njal\u2019s family unfolds, Grettir the Strong\u2019s&nbsp;strength and temper transform him into a hero, an outlaw, and a villain. Across the sea in England, Egil Skallagrimson adds to his legend to become a warrior poet above all others. And, outlawed from his home in the wake of the feud, Erik the Red sails far to the west to discover new&nbsp;lands, founding the doomed settlement known as Vinland.</span>\n\n</div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Einar, is inspired from the Vinland sagas and by Norse Mythology. Derived from the Old Norse name Einarr, which according to one of the foremost Scandanavian scholars, Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson, is connected with the concept of the einherjar, undead warriors from Norse mythology. The name, is related to the Old Norse common nouns einar\u00f0r (meaning \u201cbold\u201d) and ein\u00f6r\u00f0 (meaning \u201cvalour\u201d).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Most Viking swords fit within the Petersen Typology, described by Norwegian archaeologist Dr Jan Petersen. Petersen lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the result of his life\u2019s work as a system of classification for the Viking Sword. The Peterson Typology traces the development of the Viking Sword throughout history, from its origins in the Roman Spatha to its eventual transition into the Medieval knightly weapon. The Darksword Armory Einar Viking Sword is based on later examples in the Petersen Typology from the 10th and 11th centuries \u2013 most closely resembling the Type U with its decorative hilt and long, broad, wide-fullered blade terminating in a classic spatulate tip. The knotwork on the cast bronze hilt and the carved oak handle is inspired by actual knotwork on historical Norse artifacts, and is one of the most intricate Viking designs we\u2019ve ever attempted.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Viking swords were often status symbols, and as highly decorated as the Einar is one could assume its purpose to be decorative. Nothing could be further from the truth \u2013 hand-forged from 5160 high carbon steel and dual tempered, the Einar Viking Sword is a rugged weapon of choice. Its broad blade is resilient enough to perform the function that all Viking Swords were designed for \u2013 to cut through enemies, to split armor and shield, and to protect what the Viking warrior held dear. Despite its robust construction the Einar is surprisingly agile, able to move from cut to guard with smooth motions. In a practiced hand the Einar would be devastatingly effective on the battlefield.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Aggregating all essential elements of Viking art and Norse Mythology, the Einar exemplifies the peak of Viking culture.&nbsp;Luxuriously handcrafted from the finest material,&nbsp;the Einar is an distinguished viking sword you will be proud to own. Hand-forged from 5160 high carbon steel and dual tempered, the Einar viking sword is a rugged viking weapon of choice. Well balanced and skilfully engineered, The Einar sword blends the artistic abilities of the Norse people and the central role of warfare in the viking world.</span>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n</div>\n<img class=\"wp-image-37093 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5238-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\">",

    "content": "The form and function of the shield in medieval history is, like many other aspects of war, a story of evolution. As weapons increased in deadliness and versatility due to improvements in construction and materials, so too did the methods that we used to protect ourselves from those weapons. Many weapons were single-handed by design, which led to a natural use of the off-hand as a means of defense. The shield \u2013 a wooden or metal object gripped in the off-hand or strapped to the arm \u2013 could protect the user from slashing blades, crushing blows, even arrows. In many battles, having a well-made shield was as important as having a good weapon \u2013 if not more so. In countless cultures around the world, shields in one form or another make an appearance.\n\nEarly shields used by the Greeks and Romans were precursors of the medieval shield, and a variety of designs were utilized depending on the role of the soldier. Most famous of these was the scutum, the curved, rectangular shield of the Roman Legions. Both art and pop culture frequently depict Roman legions marching in ranks, holding their shields before them, moving as a single, perfect military unit.\n\nVikings, too, engaged in a form of combat that revolved around the use of a shield. Viking shields were typically round and made of wooden planks, with a central metal boss that protected the hand. For Vikings, the shield was a weapon as well \u2013 and when edged with metal, could be devastating when punched into an opponent\u2019s face. Even when not being used to bludgeon enemies, the Viking shield was an effective and mobile tool for defense, allowing a Viking warrior to quickly strike and then retreat back to protection. Vikings would also paint symbols and spells on their shields \u2013 for protection, for guidance, and for prowess in battle.\n\nDescendants of the Vikings (via the \u201caggressive settling\u201d of Normandy) continued to develop the shield as weapons and combat in Europe evolved. Mounted combat, especially mounted combat using lances, combined with traditional round shields resulted in a mostly unprotected left flank. By extending the shield into an almond or a leaf shape, mounted fighters could protect themselves more effectively. The use of these shields became popular during the 11th century and was frequently depicted in art. They became so widely used that the First Crusade brought with it a veritable flood of kite shields \u2013 which influenced the design and use of shields throughout the middle east for centuries.\n\nWhat evolved from the Norman kite shield was what later became known as the medieval heater shield. As armor became more effective, shields could become smaller and more agile. The heater shields (later named this due to its resemblance to a clothes iron) were thus designed with mobility in mind. They could be used mounted or on foot and were thus incredibly versatile \u2013 both armored knights and footmen could pick up and incorporate a heater shield into their different roles. The heater shield was typically constructed from layers of thin wood in a curved triangle shape that maximized surface area (and therefore protection), covered in leather or canvas. These could be incredibly affordable, which meant they could be carried by both nobles and common soldiers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCustom Shield Request Note:\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">We can do the custom shield, however, we need a vector file with a 300 dpi format.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">The size of the image should be 21.333 inches in width x 26.458 inches in height.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">There are no returns on custom Shields.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">Please contact us by email for more information on this.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_37421\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-37421 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shield-back-2-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Medieval Shield - back\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"> Medieval shield - back view[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_37423\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-37423 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shield-front-2-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Medieval shield - front\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"> French Royal Shield (#1757) - front[/caption]",
    "excerpt": "Following the traditional construction methods, our Medieval Shields are formed with thin (16) layers of wood, each individually shaped and pressed for durability. The compounded layers not only ads durability in comparison to a single, thicker layer, but also provides greater strength with lesser weight. Each layer is soaked and individually pressed to shape, eventually creating one solid defensive wall. We covered the heater shields in heavy cotton. Decorative rivets are set and topped off with a wood grip, closed cell foam backing covered in full grain leather, and adjustable forearm strap.\n\nEach shield is 30\" x 22\" and weighs 5 lbs 2 oz.",

Watch the first video review by scholagladiatoria.</p>\nhttps://youtu.be/ZiUSZJ4surM\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The process of becoming a knight has been depicted in fiction and pop culture many times. Most people in Western culture who have been exposed, even tangentially, to historical fiction are aware that a knight follows a code of honor, and may even know its name: Chivalry. Most people are probably aware that knights wear full plate armor to ride into battle or the joust. They would also be aware that knights we not born, but made, in a ceremony involving a sword being tapped on their shoulders \u2013 and some may even know that before knights undergo this ceremony, they are known as something else \u2013 squires.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The process to become a knight was this: a noble-born boy, younger than 10 years old, would be put into service learning manners, etiquette, art, weapons, and about the essential duties of knights in society. At a certain age \u2013 usually 13 or 14 \u2013 the age would graduate to become a squire, or a knight-in-training. The squire would be apprenticed to a knight, and at this point their true training would begin. The squire would help the knight care for his armor, horse, and weapons, wait on their personal needs, and generally support them as staff on a daily basis. The knight, in turn, would train the squire in the arts of war needed to be an effective combatant on the battlefield. In fact, some squires would even accompany their knights into battle, defending them and learning to wage war in the most hands-on way possible. And, when they were ready, the squire would take his final step toward becoming a knight.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Accolade \u2013 that holy ceremony in which a young man died to their old self and was \u201creborn\u201d symbolically as a knight \u2013 was a revered coming-of-age ceremony in the Middle Ages. The ceremony itself was relatively simple: at the age of 21 a squire would undergo a ritual cleanse on the eve of his knighting ceremony, then stay awake the entire night in a prayer vigil. In the morning, the squire would take his vows of obedience to his lord and to the Church, and he would arise from his knees a knight. The knight would go on to act in service, to display courtesy to ladies, and to be a force for good in the world for decades to come (at least, this was the ideal). As long as the knight was alive, though, he would always remember the squire he had once been.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Darksword Armory Squire Sword is designed with those apprentice knights in mind. A mid-length, double-edged blade crafted from tempered 5160 spring steel provides a durable and resilient striking edge. The blade is hollow-ground with a stiff spine for added strength. The simple, curved guard sets this sword apart from the standard cruciform hilt sword, and the wheel pommel is a classic design. What sets this sword apart, though, is its handling. Weighing in at less than a kilogram, the Squire is a startlingly fast and responsive sword. In the hands of a growing apprentice knight, the Squire would be a </span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">suitable training or combat weapon; in your hands, it would be a lively sword that begs to be put through its paces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Being specifically designed for close quarter combat, the Squire handles beautifully. It is a very responsive sword that feels \u201calive\u201d and light in the hand. Easily wieldable even in novice hands, the Squire sword characteristics make it a medieval weapon of choice for all collectors. The sword is perfectly balance for swift movement and powerful delivery in both cut and thrust motions.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">While historically made for the noble elites, the Squire is perfect for beginner and advanced students of the sword. </span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The diamond cross-section of the blade results in a thick spine that sharply tapers to the edge, providing good stiffness without sacrificing structural integrity. This makes the arming sword light enough in the hand to be wielded easily, yet resilient enough to withstand actual use in combat.</span>\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-28193 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/arming-sword-tang-bare-blade-forge-darksword-armory-medieval-sword.jpg\" alt=\"arming-sword-tang-bare-blade-forge-darksword-armory-medieval-sword\" width=\"1280\" height=\"456\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIGjrzukhX8\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>\n\n<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;",

As a result, these swords needed to be heavy enough to be effectively useful in combat, but light enough to move quickly and not be tiring for the wielder. For this purpose, the Squire is a perfect fit. Light and nimble, this sword is incredibly responsive and effortlessly flows from guard to cut and back again. While exquisite to handle, the Squire is strong enough to inflict considerable damage if used in combat. A far cry from the hefty two-handed swords wielded by armored and mounted knights, the Squire is the perfect sword for anyone who wants an agile, attractive sword that is just as battle ready as one twice its size.<!--more--></p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Length : 33.5\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Handle Length: 4 \u00bd\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Length: 27\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Width: 2 1/16\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Crossguard Length: 8 5/8\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Guard Depth: 7/8\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Handle Circumference: 4 \u00bc\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Weight: 2.4 lbs&nbsp;\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">P.O.B.: 3\u201d</span>",

Our swords are based on examples from literature, myth, art, and film \u2013 including our popular Lord of the Rings swords. Many more of our swords are based on surviving historical artefacts; Darksword founder Eyal Azerad has travelled to museums all over the world in order to examine swords from different eras in history, and these were replicated in our forge to exacting specifications. Many of our most popular designs, though, have been our fantasy designs, and for over a decade these unique, coveted pieces have been based on the vision our designer, Terry.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Terry and Eyal have worked closely over the last 10 years to create some of the most remarkable fantasy swords on the market. Since 2008 Terry has sketched original and fantasy-inspired swords and knives which we have endeavored to capture in steel, and these designs have been some of Darksword Armory\u2019s most sought-after. The Vindaaris is the latest of Terry\u2019s designs, and it is truly a wonder to behold.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The inspiration for the Vindaaris was twofold. First, it was inspired by the Norse myths of the light elves that allied themselves with the gods. Hailing from the ancient world of Alfheim, these elves and their weapons would be instrumental in the final battle against evil. The designer\u2019s description references this:</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><em>In the last days of the age of Gods, the All-Father Odin, summoned his allies to his throne. Among those were the glorious and enigmatic light elves from Alfheim, they and their god ruler Freyr swore their arms to the All-Father for the final battle for Midgard. These swords are among those laid at Odin\u2019s throne, forged for the end times of Ragnarok.</em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The inscription in Beleriand script reads, \u201cHonor, Loyalty, Disgrace, Vengeance\u201d \u2013 common themes from Vikings of legend and myth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The other source is, as many of our swords, is the work of J.R.R Tolkien. The elves of light in Tolkien\u2019 work made many mighty swords, and this fantasy blade more greatly resembles a sword you would see on the hip of an elf-lord than a Viking. The Tolkien \u201cheritage\u201d of the design is honoured in an alternative inscription made in the \u201cTengwar\u201d language Tolkien invented for his elves of Middle-Earth. The elven inscription on the blade is from the Volsung saga, an epic tale of Viking lore, and reads: \u201cBetter to fight and fall than live without hope.\u201d Thus, from both sources of inspiration, this would be considered an \u201celven\u201d blade.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The sword itself is a powerful two handed weapon. The unique blade is made from 5160 steel, flowing effortlessly to the flared section unlike anything else in our catalogue. The curved guard is expertly sculpted, showing cunning lines and elegant script. The leather-wrapped handle hides a robust tang, and the graceful pommel reflects the weapon\u2019s elven heritage. Make no mistake, as beautiful as this sword is it is still, in fact, a very real weapon.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">We at Darksword Armory our proud of our collaboration with Terry Maranda, and invite you to own a piece of his legacy.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/?attachment_id=30638\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-30638\"><img class=\"wp-image-30638 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Beleriand-Dialect-inscription-sword-medieval-fantasy-darksword-armory-617x800.png\" alt=\"Beleriand-Dialect-inscription-sword-medieval-fantasy-darksword-armory\" width=\"480\" height=\"622\"></a></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/?attachment_id=30614\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-30614\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-30614 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/The-Vindaaris--1499x1600.jpg\" alt=\"The-Vindaaris-Sword\" width=\"1020\" height=\"1089\"></a>",

    "content": "&nbsp;\n\nOne of the most detailed Victorian reproductions in our collection, this parade shield is an excellent example of Negroli inspired repouss\u00e9 technique.\n\nParade armor may perhaps be a misleading name, for it implies that this armor \u2013 often embossed, gilded, or otherwise highly decorated \u2013 was not also supremely functional. This was often not the case, as parade armor was not only beautiful but functional. Sometimes, so-called parade armor was actually worn in battle. Despite its use in active military service, many armors produced from the mid-16th century and onward were a canvas for artists from Germany, France, and Italy to create stunning works. And of those artisans, none were more renowned than the Negroli.\n\nThe Milanese family of armorers, led by patriarch Gian Giacomo Negroli (1463\u20131543 CE), were responsible for some of the most stunning works of art in the form of armor in human history. From the 15th century the family\u2019s influence and reputation spread until their works were commissioned by wealthy and powerful patrons. While Gian\u2019s work was exquisite in its simplicity, it would be his son Filippo Negroli (1510\u20131579 CE) who would go on to become the most recognized name in the family and the most renowned armorer of the day. Filippo\u2019s skill produced spectacular results thanks to his unparalleled mastery of the repouss\u00e9 technique, a process involving hammering and shaping the armor from the opposite side it was intended to be viewed. Used in conjunction with traditional embossing techniques it could produce simply stunning results, as evidenced by the surviving examples of Filippo\u2019s works. So sought-after was his work that patrons such as Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThe techniques employed by the Negoli and their contemporaries would go on to influence generations of armor makers, and many of these works survive to enrich our museums around the world.\n\nMore information on the Negoli armorers can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/the_steel_of_negroli_the_metropolitan_museum_journal_v_34_1999\">https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/the_steel_of_negroli_the_metropolitan_museum_journal_v_34_1999</a>\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "These 15th gauntlets originate from a private European collection. Based on the design of the gauntlets they appear to be similar in form (if not level of adornment) to the later works of Kunz Lochner and the Nuremberg armorers of the mid 16th century. For instance, the gauntlets resemble the gauntlets from the Armor of Emperor Ferdinand I currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum (though obviously lacking the gilding). For this reason the Germanic origins for the gauntlets asserted by the owner are likely, though based on the engraving the gauntlets are older than Lochner\u2019s work.\n\nThese steel gauntlets, though incomplete, are in relatively good condition considering their age. The artistic design is both simple and elegant \u2013 comprised mostly of finely etched central bands of foliage and foliage upper borders throughout the articles. The cuffs, similar to later examples out of Nuremberg, have a rolled and roped edge \u2013 again, simple and elegant. The rivets are stark, bold, and solid, providing strength still to the ancient steel. The cuffs build up into five metacarpal plates, also with etched foliage that continue the patterns seamlessly from the start. While the finger and thumb plates are lacking, the knuckle plates retain their shape and rivets. Unlike many pieces from this age, the exterior has no visible rust \u2013 only an even, light patina that does not obscure the subtle floral etching.\n\nIn remarkably good condition for their age, these 15th Century German gauntlets are an exquisite example of Renaissance Germany\u2019s armor artistry. Later iterations of gauntlets such as this would have been relegated for parade duty; these ones (originating a century before heavy plate became more and more decorative and less practical during the Negroli/Milanese period) almost certainly saw use in battle. This is an opportunity to hold and display genuine artifacts that still hold their original beauty \u2013 few opportunities like this remain.\n\n&nbsp;",
    "excerpt": "---- SOLD ----\n\n15th C. German Gauntlets\n\nProvenance: Private collection,&nbsp;\n\nCondition: Very good.&nbsp;\n\nAdvancements in arms and armor were for much of the medieval period a series of \u201cone-upmanship\u201d affairs. That is, armor would be designed to mitigate the effects of current weaponry, and weaponry would be adapted to counteract this protection. Blades that could cut boiled or hardened leather were countered with brigandine armor, which were met with stronger blades and axes, which were met with chain mail with padded gambesons beneath for shock absorption. Chain mail could be split, though, which led to advancements in the area of plate armor. Constructed from solid pieces of steel linked at the joints by chain mail or smaller plates, plate armor was a significant leap forward in technology. While swords could be made with stiff, rigid blades to attack the joints and bludgeoning weapons such as maces and war hammers were still a threat, the development of plate armor represented the dawning of a new era of warfare.\n\nWith the advent of plate armor came new opportunities for artistic expression. There are limits to the decoration one can add to chain mail, and while leather can be carved and painted it is ineffective for protection. Plate mail, though, provides a canvas for artisans to express their skills, and nowhere were these skills more broadly express than in Renaissance Europe. The artisans of Italy, Germany, and elsewhere developed many techniques to decorate armor to showcase their skills, draw attention to the wearer, and pay tribute to their lords. Gilding, inlay, damascening, encrusting, embossing, etching, engraving, and pointill\u00e9 decoration were all used with great effectiveness to create designs of surpassing beauty. As these pieces of armor were works of art in their own right, many surviving examples exist in museums and private collections around the world. It is from one of these private collections that this set comes to us.",

    "slug": "german-katzbalger",
    "link": "https://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapon/antique-weapons/german-katzbalger/",
    "content": "The advent of superior metallurgy, forging practices, and materials allowed for European swords to evolve in a completely new direction. The early 16th century saw the rise of the rapier, a (comparatively) slender double-edged sword that not only saw use in military service but in civilian defense and dueling. The rapier\u2019s popularity and widespread use led it to become known as the sword of the renaissance. However, it was not the only new design that emerged during this period.\n\nDeveloping in parallel to the rapier during the 16th century was the short, broad sword known as the Katzbalger. Unlike the rapier the Katzbalger was squat by comparison, the blade thick but typically only reaching 50-60com in length. This made the Katzbalger more effective against heavier weapons such as the Zwehanders that would have been seen in this era. The distinctive S-shaped guard (arguably the Katzbalger\u2019s most recognizable feature) provides additional support for this use \u2013 dueling swords (such as the aforementioned rapier) had cup or swept-hilt guards designed to protect from thrusts. The S-guard would have had limited effectiveness against a slender rapier, but would have held up to much more demanding use in the field.\n\nKatzbalger were popular with the German mercenaries known as the Landsknecht (\u201cServant of the Land,\u201d lit. Land Knight), and served as a sidearm to the primarily pike-wielding warriors. Similar to the use of a gladius by spear- and pilum-wielding Roman legionnaires, these sidearms would be drawn and used to stab or slash at opponents\u2019 abdomen during a pitched melee when opponents were too close for pike or crossbow. This may explain one possible meaning of the name (\u201cCat-Gutter,\u201d referencing how close-quarters combat was like a heated catfight).\n\nThis mid-19th century Katzbalger is a Victorian reproduction of a 16th-17th weapon. The blade, while worn and patinaed throughout its length, is still bright and free of deeper, more structural corrosion. Katzbalgers are known for having more than one fuller, and this piece is no exception. Three fullers grace the flat of the blade, with the outer fullers travelling approximately 1/3 the length of the blade while the center fuller travels a fulsome 2/3 length (45 cm fuller). As do many Katzbalgers this piece terminates in a spatulate tip. The blade is adorned by a distinct stamped maker\u2019s mark of faced crescent moons addorsed (facing opposite directions away from the center of the blade). Moon symbology appeared frequently on European swords, especially swords of German origin and generally signified high quality. This particular maker\u2019s mark was associated with blades from the West region of Germany, indicating that this piece\u2019s origin was likely to be in or near the city of Solingen.\n\nThe brown leather-wrapped handle has been well-preserved. As with many such weapons the oiled leather has matured in colour and depth, showing such wear as it experienced without significant degradation. A thick riser at the bade of the hand provides both comfort and stability, preventing slippage and bracing the grip. The riser shows the most wear of the entire handle with minor scoring and\ndiscoloration visible, possibly due to the edge of a gauntlet or mail glove. While Katzbalgers could come in two-handed varieties this is a single-handed version, though the handle is long enough for a two-handed grip should such leverage be needful.\n\nThe classic S-shaped guard indicative of this sword type is present. Unlike other, more decorative examples this guard is sculpted simply and with subdued adornment compared to parade weapons. The \u201cbraided cord\u201d design is common throughout surviving Renaissance weapons, but in this piece the lines are subtle, indicating an emphasis on strength and function. The sculpted end at the terminus of the guard are likewise understated. It is in the pommel where signs of true artistry emerge. The delicate folds spiral towards the base, resembling the tassel of an altar-cloth so much more than the handle of a weapon. This design, often given the description of a \u201cwrithen\u201d pommel or hilt, is evidence of the trend begun during the Renaissance and brought to fullness in the Enlightenment of adorning arms and armor as works of art. This piece shows us this balance between form and function, and we are exceedingly fortunate to witness and learn from its survival.",

    "content": "Historical Background:\n\nWhile the Renaissance was a time period in which many advances were made in the development of arms and armor, the rapier will always be its most recognized \u2013 and most beloved \u2013 offspring. Thanks to the writers of swashbuckling fiction such as Alexandre Dumas (and the many, many film, television, and stage productions they spawned) the rapier has lodged itself in public consciousness as the principal weapon of the Renaissance. And, since it was not only used in military contexts but was popular in civilian defense/dueling as well, this representation may even be accurate.\n\nThe stylized guard of the rapier hilt was developed chiefly for the protection of the hand. While concerns of a thrust to the hand were certainly not a new consideration in the 16th century and following, the advent of narrower blades and swordplay dedicated to a thrust-oriented style necessitated a more intentional protection. This resulted in the development of many different guards designed to provide protection from the thrust of an opponent\u2019s narrow rapier blade that may slip past a cruciform hilt. These designs included the cup-hilt and, later, the dish-hilt. The term \u201ccup-hilt\u201d (or less commonly \u201cbell-hilt\u201d) refers to a rapier which protected its bearer\u2019s hand by means of a dome-shaped guard. This guard was often married to straight or twisted quillons and a curved arm protecting the knuckles and terminating at the pommel. The \u201cdish-hilt\u201d rapiers were similar though with a shallower bell protecting the hand, and generally were paired with lighter blades even less suited to cutting than earlier rapiers. In this way the dish-hilt rapier was a transition design between the rapier and the small sword, which is likely why the design was reproduced in training swords such as the foil and the \u00e9p\u00e9e.\n\nProvenance:\n\nAcquired by Darksword Armory founder Eyal Azerad in Florence from a private collector, this dish-hilt rapier is a perfect example of the civilian carry swords of the mid- to late-17th century. The straight, double edged blade is of hexagonal section, giving it a stiff and ready presence. The blade is graced with a quarter 19cm fuller at the forte, and as is typical of well-preserved articles of this age there is an even pattern of wear, called a patina, visible throughout. The unfullered debole continues the mottled surface patina to the still-functional tip. Despite the age of the weapon the blade maintains its spring and vigor.\n\nThe aforementioned dish-hilt is functional yet decorated with skill. The hilt has been constructed of iron with the circular, slightly convex dish festooned at the border, decorated with engraved spirals over circles en suite (and repeated upon the pommel, indicating the entire hilt is likely original to the sword) and pierced four-pointed stars. Below the dish the twisted quillons match the twisted guard in a floral pattern, which terminates in a curl for the guar and buds at the quillons. The matched pommel with bas-relieved floral decorations and relieved button continues the delicate chisel work seen on the upper hilt. The twisted wooden grip shows the most wear of the entire piece, with remains of leather covering and worn away by use and age. The weight of the entire hilt brings the point of balance to the guard, and in the hand this swords feels now as it did when it accompanied its master through the streets of Renaissance Europe.\n\nDish-hilt rapiers such as this would have been commonplace in Spain, Italy, England, and Portugal, but the design and final resting place of this piece make a strong case for Italian origins.\n\nConsidering the addition of the blunted pommel and dish guard the closest representation in terms of typology is most likely a Type 99 according to A.V.B. Norman\u2019s The Rapier and the Small Sword, 1460-1820, though a case could be made for Type 95 due to the straight quillons. Either example are placed in the mid- to late-17th century, which would be consistent with this piece\u2019s pedigree.",

    "content": "French Court Sword, 18th C.&nbsp;\n\nProvenance: Italy,&nbsp;\n\nCondition: fair&nbsp;\n\nThe French court was a place of turmoil and intrigue. Thanks to the machinations of Louis XIV, Paris had become a renowned city of culture known to some as the \u201cnew Rome.\u201d Art, architecture, and money flowed like water, and even noble families that were in decline for some years found themselves immersed in wealth \u2013 and their ranks greatly expanded, as the king handed out land and title to his supporters and sycophants. Wealthy merchants wedded their children to the children of old nobility, and so the noble class swelled and became bloated.\n\nUndoubtedly, this expansion of the upper class (and the consequences it had for the lower classes) led to the French Revolution. It also created an environment of competition, conflict, and cut-throat rivalries between nobles new and old fighting over the king\u2019s \u2013 and the court\u2019s \u2013 favour. For this reason the dueling rapier was adapted into a smaller, more nimble, and more decorative pieces. These swords, known as smallswords or court swords, were a normal component of a noble\u2019s garb, but could also be brought out in a flash to defend one\u2019s honour \u2013 or quietly take down a rival.\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "If the individuals living during the Victorian era were anything, they were enthusiastic in their pursuits. Centuries of Renaissance advancement in art, architecture, and philosophy gave birth to a European culture that was unlike anything that came before; focused both on the bright future towards which they marched and on the rich history they left behind. As a result, much of European art during that period \u2013 whether it be paintings, statuary, or other forms of expression \u2013 was inspired by earlier works and sources. For instance, many Renaissance (and later Victorian) paintings were based on stories from the Bible or elsewhere in antiquity. Shakespeare remained wildly popular in theaters for centuries. And of course, the supposed romantic and chivalrous Middle Ages was a source of especial interest.\n\nIt was due to this seeking in the Middle Ages for inspiration that led to a resurgence of interest in all things Medieval. Many nobles, wealthy merchants, and other individuals with the wealth to pursue their interests sought to decorate their homes with \u201cartifacts\u201d from a bygone era. Unfortunately for those would be collectors the interest in owning true weapons and armor from the past outstripped the availability of said artifacts. And so, out of this interest grew a new industry in the production of replica Medieval weapons and armor.\n\nSwords, daggers, shields and armor of medieval design were all reproduced using Renaissance techniques and provided to collectors across Europe. These articles, as they were intended to be used for display purposes, were sometimes not heat treated, and were constructed primary to visually represent the swords on which they were based. For this reason an acid wash was frequently given to \u201cage\u201d the appearance, giving the impression the weapon was considerably older than it actually was. While some reproducers of this era certainly misrepresented their work as being original to the 13th or 14th centuries, in many cases the buyer knew what they were purchasing \u2013 and the reproductions were very often fine weapons in their own right, benefiting from the advanced knowledge and techniques of the 19th century smiths who created them.",
    "excerpt": "Victorian copy of English 15th C. sword, German&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nprovenance: Private collection, Germany&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nCondition: good&nbsp;\n\nLength: 102 cm&nbsp;\n\nThis Victorian replica is modelled after a single-handed late Medieval 15th century Italian arming sword. In terms of typology, this sword is nearly identical to one currently present in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, identified by Ewart Oakeshott in his seminal work The Sword in the Ages of Chivalry as a unique version of a Type XV (see Plate 24 in The Sword in the Ages of Chivalry, 1997 edition). Both the museum version and this Victorian copy share characteristics of the Type XV (such as the stiff, cut-and-thrust blade), however, both have handles that are a touch too long for the proportions of the blade to be a standard Type XV. In addition, both the museum piece and the Victorian copy are paired with a J type pommel and uniquely curved guard, as well as sharing unique blade characteristics which will be discussed shortly.\n\nThe pommel of this particular piece is aged brass with no visible peen block, and a brass fillet at the base of the handle. The curved guard with furled ends is of brightly polished steel with relatively light touches of older corrosion, prevented at some earlier date from progressing further, also with a fillet at the\n\nhandle. The handle is of polished wood and is in excellent condition. The blade itself has been given the acid-wash treatment common to Victorian reproductions of this type, resulting in an even and attractive patina free from the pitting that might otherwise mar a sword of this age. However, it is the blade geometry that sets this sword apart. The upper third of this Victorian-forged blade has been flattened, creating a level section that terminates sharply as the spine of the diamond-shaped blade resumes. As a mid-19th century replica, this antique is a unique representation of a Type XV. As Type XV swords have among the broadest possible origins, potentially originating anywhere from late 13th to 15th centuries the creator of the replica could have drawn inspiration from many sources; however, as the identical sword in Oakeshott\u2019s work is identified as being from the 15th century (and that of Italian origin) it is likely that this copy was intended to be representing this derivation as well.\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "---SOLD---\n\nPoetry book by Francesco Berni, (1497-1535)\n\nBorn in 1497 CE, Francisco Berni was a son of an impoverished doctor who found himself living and working in the service of the Catholic Church from a young age. Finding his experiences in the church dissatisfying (possibly due to a sympathy for the Reformation) Berni began developing a reputation as a writer - first as a playwright, later as a satirist, an occupation at which he was so successful he was sent away from Rome for a time. Later, working as a clerk for Italian Bishop Gian Matteo Giberti, Berni established himself in the literary scene of Renaissance Italy with a flourish. His verse - known for biting wit, satirical observations, double entendre, and fluid prose \u2013 established and named the Bernesque poetry genre. Traditionally, Berni is said to have been poisoned at the order of Alessandro de Medici, patriarch of the Medici family and Duke of Florence.\n<h1 id=\"firstHeading\" class=\"firstHeading\">&nbsp;</h1>",

A second edition in remarkable condition, it is sure to impress students of the Bernesque poetry era.&nbsp;\n\nThis second edition is estimated to have been printed in 1650, and for its age is in outstanding condition. The cover lacks both significant identifiers and the damage one would anticipate from an article of this age - many books would have water damage beyond repair, yet this piece has only surface aging at most. All pages are intact and legible with none of the degradation that modern books, with acid-pulp paper), would develop. It goes without saying that scent of this book is as antique as its appearance \u2013 for purveyors of rare or antique books, this is a remarkable piece for a remarkable price.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "English Victorian Copy, 1880,\n\nA Victorian copy of an original residing in the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, this burgonet is a stunning example of 19th century electrotyping techniques.\n\nIn the Victorian era, the growing merchant class presented a problem for those of noble rank. Rising from common roots, yet possessing wealth sometimes greater than the nobility, the merchant class began to be capable of wielding significant power. Many nobles found themselves deeply in debt to these merchants, further eroding their power. The advance of the Renaissance left many merchants with expansive holdings of their own to rival the hereditary families of the era. As these merchants gained their wealth they would often spend it on art and cultural pursuits, yet lacked the inherited material wealth (such as family heirlooms, weapons, and armor) that would be present in noble families. This was one reason for the advent of Victorian copies of historical arms and armor.\n\nMany such copies would be reproduced in a similar fashion as the historical arms and armor themselves \u2013 forged by a smith using traditional techniques. However, when reproducing finely detailed pieces that were as much art as they were functional articles of war considerably more skill would be required. The newly discovered practice of electrotyping drastically simplified this process.\n\nBy running an electrical current through a solution of sulfuric acid and copper sulfate, copper can be bonded exactly to a pre-made mold. Electrotyping was used to make copies of wooden carvings, printing press plates, coins, and \u2013 eventually \u2013 historical artifacts including exquisite pieces of armor such as the one in this collection. A revolutionary process, electrotyping allowed the growing merchant class to possess exact copies of the artifacts their noble counterparts had held for generations. From those merchants come many pieces in museums and private collections.",
    "excerpt": "English Victorian Copy, 1880,\n\nProvenance\n\nA Victorian copy of an original residing in the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.&nbsp;\n\nJohn Wigington, sold Parke-Bernet Galleries Inc., New York, 4 October 1951,&nbsp;\n\nProvenance Victoria and Albert (V&amp;A) Museum, London, inv no. 2922 John Wigington, sold Parke-Bernet Galleries Inc., New York, 4 October 1951,\n\nAvailable for the discerning collector is this North Italian burgonet (parade helm). The electrotype was made by Elkington and Co Ltd of Birmingham from an original helmet that was at that time in the imperial collections of the Tsarkoe Selo near St Petersburg and is now in the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, Acc. No, 3. 3420 (Gille &amp; Rockstuhl 1835-53, pt. 7, pl. XXXIV; and Godoy 2003, No. 16, pp. 100-1 &amp; 421). The piece has been dated to approximately 1880 CE.\n\nThe inspiration of the original appears to have been the slightly earlier work of the celebrated Negroli family armor makers. The helm itself is formed in one piece rising at its rear to a medial crest formed as a recumbent sphinx with a tubular plume-holder straddling its tail, projecting forwards to a slightly down-turned, obtusely-pointed integral peak at its rear to an outward-\n\nflanged neck-guard, also obtusely pointed, and formed around its main edge with a boldly roped turn. Its surfaces are embossed in high relief with scrolling acanthus foliage and fruits involving at the front a classical warrior and a Medusa\u2019s head (a classic image in every sense of the word and proof of the Negroli inspiriation). At each side are embossed male nudes and putti, and at the rear, herons grasping snakes in their beaks and a lion\u2019s mask (worn in parts). Fitted internally over the left ear is the oval seal of the Elkington company bearing at its Center the royal cipher VR.\n\nThis burgonet stands 11 \u00bd\u201d high and would be best displayed on a stand as a conversation piece in a foyer or sitting room.",

    "slug": "child-armor",
    "link": "https://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapon/antique-weapons/child-armor/",
    "content": "The concept of creating armor for children may seem like an extravagance. For one thing, children are always growing, and a suit of armor that may take a significant amount of time to produce will be outgrown in a fraction of the time. For another, children were unlikely to be combatants in an armed conflict, making the armor they wore superfluous. However, many surviving examples of child armor exist to this day and there are several reasons for this.\n\nProducing child-sized armor is a practice that occurred beginning at the latest in the 14th century, though it is possible some armorsmiths were making the effort beforehand. One of the chief reasons for the production of miniaturized versions of adult armor to be produced was as part of the training of an smith. Producing full-size armor took undeniable skill, but it also took a not-insignificant amount of material resources. By practicing with smaller components and eventually full sets of armor on a smaller scale, the armorer became familiar with the structure and function of each individual piece, allowing them to scale these pieces up when producing full sized sets of armor. At least some of the surviving child armor that exists today was likely produced for this purpose. Master armorers would additionally produce miniaturized sets of armor as a way of showcasing their skill, sometimes creating incredibly intricate and detailed pieces.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_46000\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"278\"]<img class=\"wp-image-46000\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/88111-antique-armor-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"431\"> Full sets of these child armor are on display in the Royal Armories of England, for instance, as well as many other collections both public and private around the world.[/caption]\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-46001\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/88111-antique-armor.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"282\" height=\"429\">Another reason for the practice was political. Nobles and monarchs had a vested interest in maintaining the public\u2019s belief in their fundamental and hereditary right to rule, and this included preparing the public to be ruled by the next generation. Many children of monarchs and other nobility were given suits of armor and displayed publicly in order to establish both legitimacy and continuity with the previous generation. For instance, as a child Philip III of Spain was gifted incredibly beautiful gilded armor by his father Philip II, and was painted wearing this armor into scenes surrounded by powerful historical and allegorical figures.\n\n&nbsp;",
    "excerpt": "Child Armor, on stand&nbsp;\n\nprovenance: Germany, estate sale&nbsp;\n\nCondition: good\n\nspecs: 38\" x 5\"&nbsp; &nbsp;616 grams&nbsp;\n\nProcured from an estate sale in Germany, this remnant of a suit of armor is forged in a child\u2019s size, showcasing the skill of the armorer involved.\n\nWhat remains of this suit of armor is the arm harness, consisting of the rerebrace, couter, and vambrace. The rerebrace is the shortest piece and would cover the upper arm and would be overlapped by the pauldron. While none of the leather strapping survived on the rerebrace, the buckle remains and would be in working condition if a strap were attached. The hinges on the vambrace (which would cover the child\u2019s forearm) are functional and will allow for the vambrace to be opened. All rivets remain as intended. The wear of this antique is even and mild on the exterior, though the interior has more significant rusting.\n\nThe design and etching of the piece is partially obscured by the deep and even patina, but is visible in places. The edges of both the rerebrace and the vambrace are \u201croped\u201d in the style of many Maximilian pieces, though the couter lacks the associated fluting. Slight etching, ringing the forearm in two places, is visible on the vambrace. The d\u00e9cor and aging of the piece make a 15th century origin most likely. The entire piece is 38\u2033 in length when extended, and may have belonged to a child as young as 7 years old. The weight of this piece is 616 grams.\n\nThe child armor piece comes with a stand and would be an attractive conversation piece on a side table or in an entry hall.\n\n&nbsp;",

They would travel into towns and purchase swords and other bronze and iron objects from craftsmen there. Although these horsemen were pre-literate, we know from the records of the Elamites and other southern neighbors that these tribesmen functioned as mercenaries in the constant warfare between the Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Elamites. When they died, they were buried in rock-covered tombs with their weapons. Comes with custom stand. Size: 1.5\" W x 16.1\" H (3.8 cm x 40.9 cm)",

Variations of incredibly well-documented Eastern arts exist across Asia, whereas the European examples are much more sparse. This is not to say that no such training existed \u2013 we do have some surviving texts, and while fencing schools typically did not stay in operation for centuries after swords fell into disuse we do have some idea of what was taught. Tragically, though, the oldest training regimes are lost to time. The exception to this is the works of Fiore dei Liberi, late 14th century knight and author of one of Europe\u2019s oldest known fencing manual \u2013 Fior di Battaglia, The Flower of Battle.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 140%;\">Born in 1350 CE Italy to noble heritage, Fiore dei Liberi belonged to a family of landed knights in service of the state. From a young age Fiore showed significant prowess in the arts of martial combat, and his family paid well for him to train</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 140%;\">under Italian and German masters. Blessed not only with skills but with no small amount of confidence, Fiore advanced to the point that his masters purportedly began asking him to train them. According to his writing Fiore defeated several of the most \u201cunworthy\u201d of those masters in duels with sharpened swords, and left sometime prior to 1383 CE to begin travelling and training students across the Empire.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 140%;\">The text of Fior di Battaglia grew out of Fiore\u2019s experiences and expertise. Part an account of Fiore\u2019s deeds, part instruction manual on melee combat, the book is startling in its scope and breadth. Grappling, dagger-fighting, one-handed sword, sword and buckler, spear, quarterstaff, polearms, and the two-handed sword technique that would be perfected during the Italian Renaissance. Four copies of Fiore\u2019s manuscript survived, giving us an incredible inside look into the mind and art of one of history\u2019s greatest swordmasters - and the foundation on which much of the great Italian school of fencing was built.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 140%;\">The Baron Sword is a true longsword of the early Renaissance Italian style. Growing out of the designs of the late Middle Ages, the Baron \u2013 classified a Type XVIa in Oaeshott\u2019s typology \u2013 is exactly the kind of sword that would be used in the Italian fencing schools. The long, tapered blade comes to a sharp point suitable for the cut-and-thrust two-handed style common in the Italian schools, and has deep double fullers that are more commonly seen on later European designs. The extended cruciform guard and scentstopper pommel, also distinctly Italian from this period, give the weapon a unique appearance. And when it comes to handling, the Baron will not disappoint \u2013 the long handle and stiff blade are perfectly balanced, and to more through even the most demanding technique with ease.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 140%;\">Bringing together all the lessons learned during long years of the Middle Ages, combined with the talent and skills of early Renaissance Italy, Italian swordmanship is among the pinnacle of what Historical European Martial Arts can offer. The Baron Sword would be an appropriate weapon for any student of those ancient masters \u2013 perhaps even good enough for the great Fiore dei Liberi himself</span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 140%;\">Hand crafted and properly engineered for durability in combat, the Baron Sword is a very solid, responsive, and a well balanced Medieval sword. The Baron boasts a long, tapered traditional blade common to 15th Century medieval swords.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 140%;\">The blade, hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel, is skilfully Dual Hardened for precise cutting while remaining flexible for enduring combat.

We are very proud of this piece. It is light, responsive, seamless and a true joy to wield. </span><span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Exemplifying the spirit and aesthetic of pre-Renaissance Italy, the Baron Sword is a classic transitory piece. The Baron longsword is based on the Oakeshott Type XVIa design, a style of longsword that was an evolutionary step between the arming swords of the Middle Ages and the fencing longswords of the Renaissance. The long, double-fullered blade performs incredibly well when put through its paces, straddling the line between light handling and power. Steel fittings and a scentstopper pommel complete this piece, a powerful reminder of the early days of Italy\u2019s transformation into the hear of Renaissance Europe.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<span style=\"font-size: 120%;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

The pointed or cone shaped visor resembles a dog muzzle or pig face and those terms became interchangeable in identifying this type of helmet as a \u201cHound Skull\u201d or \u201cPig Face\u201d Bascinet. The shape was for more than good looks; it was effective at deflecting blows and provide better ventilation and breathing.

Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, its edge was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it And\u00faril, Flame of the West.\u201d</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">\u2015 J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In 1937, a British First World War veteran and college professor named John Ronald Reuel Tolkien quietly published an unusual book. The book was entitled, \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d and was the sort of story that \u2013 unexpectedly to its author \u2013 gripped the imagination of every generation since. The Hobbit was the first of Tolkien\u2019s books set in the land of Middle-earth, a fictionalized version of Europe\u2019s long distant past. The most famous of these books was The Lord of the Rings, a three-part epic high fantasy novel that was absolutely formative for the fantasy genre and the subject of inspiration (if not outright plagiarism) for every author that came afterward. Films and stage productions have been made of his works, college and universities teach courses and seminars about the meaning of his books \u2013 were they pure fiction? Or political allegory?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In letters written later in his life, Tolkien admitted that his books were not (as was the popular understanding) an allegory for the Second World War, or even for the First World War in which he served and lost all but one of his childhood friends. Instead, his books were intended to be a modern take on the classic faerie story \u2013 a tale that would have not only internal consistency but outward applicability in any age. Perhaps this is why the stories continue to give inspiration and meaning to people born many decades since they were originally written \u2013 a fact that would please Tolkien greatly. And as a faerie story, there are many examples of strange and magical weapons in the pages of The Lord of the Rings \u2013 none are more famous than Anduril.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">In order to understand the importance of the Anduril sword, one must first understand its position in the history of Middle-earth. During a time known as the Second Age there was a great island kingdom called N\u00famenor, whose kings were descendants of a union of Humans and Elves. This mighty race of explorers grew powerful, and prideful in their power, so much so that they sought even to challenge the gods. This was to be their downfall, and the island of N\u00famenor was sunk beneath the ocean in a terrible cataclysm. The surviving few, a faithful remnant of N\u00famenor, travelled to the mainland and founded the kingdoms-in-exile of Gondor and Arnor. The ruler of these kingdoms was Elendil, High King, and out of the ruins of N\u00famenor he carried with him the ancient sword Narsil \u2013 an heirloom from the first king of the N\u00famenoreans.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">War came to Middle-earth, and Elendil raised up his people to march along side the Elves and their King, Gil-galad. The Last Alliance brought their might against the forces of Mordor and the Dark Lord Sauron, who wielded the terrible power of the One Ring against them. Forced to face Sauron himself in single combat, the sword Narsil was broken and Eldendil was slain. Isildur, the heir of Elendil, took up the broken shard of Narsil and cut the One Ring from Sauron\u2019s hand, ending his terrible reign over the free peoples of Middle-earth. The shards of Narsil were passed down in the family, even after the House of Elendil fell into decay and they were Kings no longer.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">When the events of the first book of The Lord of the Rings begin, the One Ring (thought lost to time for centuries) has been found, and the scattered remnants of the people of Middle-earth must rally for another war. A distant descendant of Elendil \u2013 the ranger Aragorn, not a king but a wanderer in the wilderness \u2013 must take up both the cause of his ancestors and the blade to defeat Sauron once and for all. The shards of Narsil are reforged by the Elves, and into Aragorn\u2019s hands is given a new sword \u2013 Anduril, the Flame of the West. Aragorn rises to lead Middle-earth, Anduril in hand, and bring them out of the shadow and into a future free from Sauron\u2019s tyranny as the new king of Gondor. Anduril is at the center of this mythological story arc, as depicted in the poem Tolkien wrote about the hero Aragorn\u2019s journey:</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">All that is gold does not glitter,</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Not all those who wander are lost;</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The old that is strong does not wither,</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Deep roots are not reached by the frost.</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">From the ashes a fire shall be woken,</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">A light from the shadows shall spring;</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Renewed shall be blade that was broken,</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The crownless again shall be king.</span></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">-J.R.R. Tolkien</p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">As fans of Tolkien\u2019s incredible works, we at Darksword Armory are pleased to recreate the sword of the King of Gondor. The Darksword Armory Anduril is hand Crafted with 5160 High Carbon steel, dual hardened to a Rockwell of 60 at the edge and 48-50 at the core. The beautifully detailed leather handle is accentuated by the unique pommel, making this one of the most recognized fantasy swords. The blade is forged with a deep full length fuller. The Anduril sword, as with all our swords, is a powerful battle ready sword, capable of delivering considerable damage with a two-handed swing. This is a favorite among fantasy sword collectors, and for good reason. We are proud to contribute even in a small way to the appreciation of the work of a literary master such as Tolkien.</span>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/45432CwFA1E\" width=\"660\" height=\"415\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center>\n\n<hr>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-28135 size-thumbnail aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/1970/01/anduril-sword-tang-peened-1309-darksword-armory-2-340x340.jpg\" alt=\"anduril-sword-tang-peened-1309-darksword-armory-2\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-46301 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20220106_123757_resized-rotated.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"498\">",

    "content": "Medieval advancements in armor, while hardly a linear progression of development, nevertheless went through several distinct stages. From chain mail shirts to hauberks to the transitional armors of the 14th century (which combined mail with plate, splint, or other hardened forms of defense at the joints and other vulnerable points) there were recognizable milestones of evolution as physical protection for soldiers improved considerably through the centuries. The development of plate armor allowed warriors to experience greater protection than ever before, but as the strength of the steel plating also resulted in inflexibility early forms of this armor would only cover the chest, back, and limbs \u2013 leaving the rest of the body to be covered by chainmail. This created natural gaps in protection that invited exploitation.\n\nFull suits of plate armor \u2013 sometimes called \u201cwhite armor\u201d \u2013 became possible as the skills of armorers increased throughout the centuries. Late 14th/early 15th century developments in articulation of steel joints resulted in the \u201cknight in shining armor\u201d that features so prominently at the forefront of our romanticized view of the Middle Ages. Closing those gaps in protection led to the domination of many a battlefield by armored and mounted knights, nigh-invulnerable behind their suits of steel \u2013 until weapons technology evolved yet again to provide countermeasures.\n\nAs plate armor became more prevalent it developed in several distinctive styles, and of those styles the German Gothic armors were among the most instantly recognizable. Early forms of Gothic armor would include raised ridges and sharp lines on the body \u2013 partially as a method of increasing protection by thickening sections of armor, and partly for aesthetics. By the early 16th century this would evolve into what is known as Maximillian armor, distinguished by elaborate fluting and the classical Gothic sallet helm. As much art as it was military hardware, several articles of Gothic plate survive to this day cared for in private collections and museums around the world.&nbsp;",

Like so many Victorian reproductions the original has been replicated in exacting detail right down to the rivets and hinges.&nbsp;\n\nThe vambrace and rerebrace both have the attractive ridges of classical Gothic plate, flowing seamlessly into the lines of the armor. The couter is broad and fluted with a raised point at the elbow, providing not only protection but a potentially dangerous weapon in its own right \u2013someone in Gothic plate is never unarmed. Despite its age the armor has only a light patina in some areas, retaining its luster and sheen \u2013 clearly, this piece was well cared for in its life as an antique. An attractive centerpiece for any collection, this Gothic arm armor comes to us from a prestigious collection and is now available for purchase for one fortunate collector.",

    "content": "Based on an original of probable Northern Italian origins, this breastplate is a cast-iron replica from the Victorian period. The breastplate is of a design known as a cuirass when combined with a backplate. Cuirasses of this type and from this era were made thick enough to withstand shot from a musket, an absolutely essential quality for combat in this age. Cavalry officers would pair simple forms of this armor with a uniform and helm or hat depending on the year and location. Those of noble background would be able to afford more high quality, embossed armor similar to this piece.\n\nWith virtually no marring of the finish, this Victorian copy of a North Italian breastplate is in excellent condition.&nbsp;\n\nThe design on the armor gives credence to the Italian pedigree. Soldiers in roman garb and helm adorn the piece, standing together at rest in front of what appears to be a military style tent and a building. Angels, flanking the medusa head (showing Negroli inspiration) sound trumpets, possibly meant to inspire a belief that God would bring victory to the wearer. Floral scrollwork winds its way across the entire piece, worked in expertly in the embossing technique common to Italian armor makers.",

    "content": "In our modern world we have few examples left of a craft that would be passed down through the generations. While some arts, sports, and physical skills are indeed taught from parent to child, and certain vocations (such as agriculture) are typically kept within a family, we must look back through the centuries for examples of professions that are truly generational. Armor smithing is one such skill set, and it is an art that takes several lifetimes to fully develop. Part of the process of training a new generation involves producing samples of a craft, and it is for this reason we have surviving suits of \u201cminiature armor.\u201d\n\nThe practice of constructing miniature suits of armor is an interesting one. We have multiple examples of suits of armor modelled after different styles of full-size armor, some fully articulated and functional, others clearly intended to be almost statues on display. There are several reasons why smiths would engage in the practice. At the most practical level, new smiths would be required to practice technique on a smaller scale (thus wasting less materials) before moving on the full sized suits for actual use. Slightly less practically oriented, small suits of armor would be made for children of nobles and royalty for parade purposes (and, in some cases, to get them accustomed to wearing armor for extended periods of time). Finally, suits of miniature armor made to look like true, full-sized armor yet lacking full articulation and joints would be created for display purposes, such as in guildhalls or for collections in wealthy homes.",
    "excerpt": "Miniature Armor, Victorian period, hand forged, 1820\n\ndimensions: 30\"(H) x 8.5\" (W)&nbsp;\n\nrotating helmet, raiseable visor&nbsp;\n\nThis suit of miniature armor was acquired from a private collection in Milan. The piece is a Victorian reproduction dated to on or around 1820 CE. It stands 30\u201d in height.&nbsp;\n\nThe design of this armor is clearly intended to be Gothic \u2013 the couters, gauntlets, and cuisses are all classically Maximillian, and the fluting on the surface of the cuirass and elsewhere are undeniably intended to replicate the patterns of 15th \u2013 16th century armors that would exemplify the Gothic style. A brief chain skirt protects the lower body, and an s-guard longsword (possibly intended to imply Swiss inspiration, perhaps a mercenary) is held in the right hand. While the suit is not fully articulate, the helm can rotate and the visor can be raised if so desired.\n\nThe Victorian origins, style of armor reproduced, and non-articulating construction of the piece points to this piece\u2019s likely purpose as a collectible for a wealthy patron. The nineteenth-century \u201cGothic revival\u201d obsession likely resulted in many such reproductions being created, which is almost certainly the origin of this piece as well.&nbsp;",

    "content": "1825 Anvil hardy\n\nProvenance: John Woodman Higgins Armory Collection&nbsp;\n\nThis anvil hardy is in design a practical tool. An extended piece tapers to a square suitable for securing to most anvils equipped for this type of tool. Once in place, the hardy would be able to withstand the heavy use needed to be a functional component of a blacksmith\u2019s kit. The sharp edge can be used to shape and cut steel during the smithing process, but can also be used for more delicate work. By placing portions of armor against the sharp edge the artist could create the fluting so common in surviving Gothic armors \u2013 a practical addition as well as an attractive one, as fluting helped diffuse the force of blows and prevent structural failure for the armor as a whole. As the age of this hardy has been placed at 1825, it is highly likely that it was used in this regard.\n\nVisually, the hardy is in excellent condition. A light patina evenly covers the surface of the metal, yet does not completely eliminate the rich luster of the steel. The steel itself contains several elements of artistry, first and most recognizable being the date (1825) halfway up the shaft, surely shaped by stencil as the lines are so crisp. Opposite this is a simple carved fish, often a religious symbol. But it is the floral motif that crawls up the side of this piece that most draws the eye. Extensive carvings of branch, leaf, and fruit are lovingly detailed on this most practical of smithing tools, an oddity only for those who underestimate humanity\u2019s appreciation for beauty in all things. The d\u00e9cor on a piece such as this is the purest form of artistic expression, made for no accolades or crowds. This was a piece made for the artist themselves, who carved it thusly for the joy of it \u2013 nothing more. Be assured that this artifact was made by a master of his craft; surely the reason why it was previously displayed in the John Higgins Armory.",
    "excerpt": "1825 Anvil hardy\nProvenance: John Woodman Higgins Armory Collection&nbsp;\n\nBlacksmithing, as a profession, was as much science as it was art. Metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, and physics \u2013 all of them went into the proper construction of arms and armor to ensure they would live up to the life-and-death demands placed upon them. As these arts advanced in understanding and complexity the goal turned from not only making functional articles of war but beautiful ones. As a result, those in arms and armor related industries have a strong appreciation for those historical artists whose work we admire and seek to emulate.\n\nAmong the tools used by blacksmiths, armorsmiths, and other historical metalworking artists were many common items. Anvils, hammers, and tongs are all recognizable even for someone with little to no knowledge of the field. An anvil hardy, though, would almost certainly confound the casual observer as to its origin and purpose. In fact, it could be mistaken for an axe head until the square feature at the base is recognized for what it is meant to do \u2013 to slip into the work hole at the top of an anvil and made fast for its use in shaping and cutting steel along with other, more delicate work.",

    "content": "In history and literature, a Black Knight is a mysterious warrior who hides their identity in order to disguise their motives and allegiance. The Darksword Armory Black Knight Dagger is a nod to this literary and historical character, blending historical design with a fantasy flare. The straight, tempered, double-edged blade is the companion dagger to the Black Knight sword, available in our sword gallery page. With full tang construction this dagger is fully functional, as all our swords and daggers, and has been carefully forged and balanced to be an effective and deadly line of defense. Swords and dagger of the 15th C. were not only exceptionally engineered, but also showed clear artistic patterns and influences from the gothic architectural structures of the time.\n\n5160 High Carbon Steel\nFittings : Mild Steel\nTotal Length: 18\"\nBlade Length : 12\"\nWeight: 1 lb.",
    "excerpt": "This \u201cfishtail\u201d Gothic Dagger was very popular in Germany during the mid to late 15th century. As the Middle Ages progressed, this versatile dagger continued to evolve according to the battlefield requirements of the day.",

As avid amateur cooks, we have sought the best grips, bolster angles, blade shapes and widths to allow anyone interested in the art of cooking to have a proper grip and hold. The sloped bolster tapers gradually from grip to blade, enabling a proper and comfortable pinch grip and therefore greater control while cooking.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 130%;\">Although quite comfortable during the prototyping stage, we decided to expand the clearance of the blade to allow the user greater range of motion regardless of the types of cutting (mincing, chopping, slicing or dicing).

    "content": "Historical Background:\n\nWhile the Renaissance was a time period in which many advances were made in the development of arms and armor, the rapier will always be its most recognized \u2013 and most beloved \u2013 offspring. The rapier has lodged itself in public consciousness as the principal weapon of the Renaissance. And, since it was not only used in military contexts but was popular in civilian defense/dueling as well, this representation may even be accurate.\n\nThe stylized guard of the rapier hilt was developed chiefly for the protection of the hand. While concerns of a thrust to the hand were certainly not a new consideration in the 16th century and following, the advent of narrower blades and swordplay dedicated to a thrust-oriented style necessitated a more intentional protection. This resulted in the development of many different guards designed to provide protection from the thrust of an opponent\u2019s narrow rapier blade that may slip past a cruciform hilt. These designs included the cup-hilt and, later, the dish-hilt. The term \u201ccup-hilt\u201d (or less commonly \u201cbell-hilt\u201d) refers to a rapier which protected its bearer\u2019s hand by means of a dome-shaped guard. This guard was often married to straight or twisted quillons and a curved arm protecting the knuckles and terminating at the pommel. The \u201cdish-hilt\u201d rapiers were similar though with a shallower bell protecting the hand, and generally were paired with lighter blades even less suited to cutting than earlier rapiers. In this way the dish-hilt rapier was a transition design between the rapier and the small sword, which is likely why the design was reproduced in training swords such as the foil and the \u00e9p\u00e9e.\n\nProvenance:\n\nAcquired by Darksword Armory founder Eyal Azerad in Germany from a private collector,\n\nCopper inlay blade inscription \"Soli Deo Gloria\", iron knuckle-bow hilt with wire-wrapped grip and barrel-shaped pommel with a small rivet pommel. Length 108cm.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nthis dish-hilt rapier is a perfect example of the civilian carry swords of the mid- to late-17th century. The straight, double edged blade is of hexagonal section, giving it a stiff and ready presence. The blade is graced with a quarter 19cm fuller at the forte, and as is typical of well-preserved articles of this age there is an even pattern of wear, called a patina, visible throughout. The unfullered debole continues the mottled surface patina to the still-functional tip. Despite the age of the weapon the blade maintains its spring and vigor.\n\nThe aforementioned dish-hilt is functional yet decorated with skill. The hilt has been constructed of iron with the circular, slightly convex dish festooned at the border, decorated with engraved spirals over circles en suite (and repeated upon the pommel, indicating the entire hilt is likely original to the sword) and pierced four-pointed stars. Below the dish the twisted quillons match the twisted guard in a floral pattern, which terminates in a curl for the guar and buds at the quillons. The matched pommel with bas-relieved floral decorations and relieved button continues the delicate chisel work seen on the upper hilt. The twisted wooden grip shows the most wear of the entire piece, with remains of leather covering and worn away by use and age. The weight of the entire hilt brings the point of balance to the guard, and in the hand this swords feels now as it did when it accompanied its master through the streets of Renaissance Europe.\n\nDish-hilt rapiers such as this would have been commonplace in Spain, Italy, England, and Portugal, but the design and final resting place of this piece make a strong case for Italian origins.\n\nConsidering the addition of the blunted pommel and dish guard the closest representation in terms of typology is most likely a Type 99 according to A.V.B. Norman\u2019s The Rapier and the Small Sword, 1460-1820, though a case could be made for Type 95 due to the straight quillons. Either example are placed in the mid- to late-17th century, which would be consistent with this piece\u2019s pedigree.",

Though these wars did not prevent the inexorable march of reason and progress, they did disrupt life and political boundaries for many. In some ways, the battles that reshaped borders during this time contributed greatly to the driving of the cultural revolution that defined this epoch\u2026 primarily through the transfer of wealth and power into the hands of the victors.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-48893\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1551-two-handed-german-sword-6-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"582\" height=\"970\">The area we now know as Germany was the centre of many of these conflicts in the 15th and 16th centuries. While the nation itself was not in its current version formed, many significant battles were fought on its soil and by its peoples. Some of these battles were even between Germ\n\nanic peoples \u2013 for instance, the Zweiter Markgrafenkrieg, or Second Margrave War, saw Margrave Albert Alcibiades (a commander of the Holy Roman Empire\u2019s forces in Germany) protest the signed peace accord between Catholics and Protestants by taking his army on a whirlwind plunder tour of Germany. An allied army would march to defeat Albert in the Battle of Sievershausen. Another pivotal battle would be the Battle of Drakenburg in May 1547, which involved a Protestant army facing down the Imperial Roman (Catholic) forces with Germans on both sides. The Catholic army (under Eric II, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg) would be defeated and scattered, leaving Germany to become a Protestant region.\n\nThese battles brought German war prowess and technology into sharp focus, as it did elsewhere in Europe at the time \u2013 that is, advancements in arms and armor were only accelerating. For centuries in one of the first examples of a true arms race, countries across Europe attempted to outdo their enemies weapons by creating better, more protective armor \u2013 and to counter their enemies armor by creating better weapons. When the Renaissance arrived the arms race picked up speed, resulting in new generations of swords that were larger and more powerful than their predecessors yet still able to handle nimbly and outperform the longswords of the Middle Ages while defeating the current armor. These weapons would prove their worth on the battlefield.\n\nThe Darksword Armory Olbrecht owes its origins to those 16th century battlefields. We designed it as a Type XX according to Oakeshott\u2019s typology, which was the final Type in his 1964 edition of The Sword in the Age of Chivalry (later editions added to the list). Type XX swords are designed with long, broad blades, and the Olbrecht is no exception. Unique to this Type is the number of fullers, which can vary \u2013 the Olbrecht follows a handful of surviving examples in having two shallow fullers. Also common to the\n\ndesign, the blade is paired with a scentstopper pommel and a simple yet graceful guard. The 10\u201d long handle is also consistent with this Type, and provides a counter-balance to the robust blade.\n\nThe name Olbrecht \u2013 meaning \u201cNoble\u201d or \u201cBright\u201d \u2013 was chosen as the sword gave us the impression of a shining and gallant weapon. Due to their size and weight many of the larger Type XX swords were intended to be ceremonial \u201cbearing swords\u201d \u2013 ceremonial weapons not used in war but in display, parade, and other demonstrations of wealth and power. These bearing swords would be far too heavy (and too heavily decorated) to be of any practical use, and would instead be carried by a squire or other servant. The Olbrecht, though, is unmistakably a weapon of war \u2013 when held in the hand it has blade presence, yet is well-balanced enough to wield smoothly. If you are looking for a classic yet unique design, look no further than the Olbrecht.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp;<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIGjrzukhX8\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

A late evolution of the medieval sword, the Type XX\u2019s broad, refined blade is designed to effect powerful strokes with devastating results. Twin fullers give the blade a unique design while both adding strength and reducing weight. Like many Renaissance two-handed warswords the handle is long and designed to provide adequate leverage for heavy blows. A scentstopper pommel (common to the Type XX) and long, slightly curved guard complete the weapon. While some of the larger two-handed swords of Type XX style were decorative in purpose, the Olbrecht is a true battle-ready sword \u2013 even if there are no longer battles for it to fight.</span></h2>\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">SPECS:</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 100%;\">Total Length : 49.5\u201d</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 100%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Length: 36\u201d\ngrip: 10\"\nBlade Width: 2 1/16\u201d\nCrossguard Length: 10\u201d\nGuard Depth: 7/8\u201d\nWeight: 3lbs 11oz.&nbsp;\nP.O.B.: 4 \u00be\u201d</span>",

Wars had always redrawn borders and consolidated power into rulers\u2019 hands (or, as the case may be, removed it), but with the advent of the Renaissance a new arena emerged in which humans could do battle. Merchant families \u2013 families that had no hereditary titles, yet did manage to create successful enterprises \u2013 rose to sudden power, and suddenly the nobles who had enjoyed power and authority unchallenged found themselves outmatched in these new economic feuds. Of these Renaissance merchant families, none wielded more influence than the House of Medici.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-48990\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1552-The-Medici-longsword-sketch.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"551\" height=\"918\">In the late 14th century the House of Medici, historically a family that dealt primarily in textiles and wool, established a bank in the Republic of Florence. This bank (the Medici Bank) appeared at precisely the right time to slide into the void left by the sudden and unexpected bankruptcy of the Gran Tavola, at the time one of the largest banks in Europe. This excellent timing catapulted the House of Medici to fame and fortune, and of course considerable political power as well. This was to the great alarm of the existing nobility, who watched with dismay as families of \u201clow\u201d birth suddenly acquired wealth beyond what the nobles themselves had \u2013 if, indeed, they had any left at all. The Medici Bank would be a European institution, and became the official bank of the Vatican, bringing Florence (and the Medicis) considerable wealth. This wealth would actually create the Renaissance itself as the House of Medici funded an unprecedented amount of art, music, architecture, and culture. Among other things, the Medici bankrolled the construction of the Florence cathedral as well as St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and some claimed they funded the invention of opera and the piano. Some of the history of the House of Medici is recounted in the popular Netflix series Medici, which covers some of the family\u2019s history in the mid-15th century. Focusing on brothers Cosimo and Lorenzo de' Medici, sons of the family patriarch Giovanni de' Medici, it details the rising political and cultural power of the House of Medici \u2013 and the enemies they make along the way. The series is relatively well done, with high production values, gorgeous set design, and excellent acting from the members of House Medici (although for our part, our favourite character isn\u2019t even one of the Medici family \u2013 it\u2019s Marco Bello, the no-nonsense servant and bodyguard of Cosimo de' Medici).\n\nWhile art and culture (largely funded by the House of Medici) brought about the next stage of human history, developments in arms and armor continued apace. The two-handed greatswords of the&nbsp;Renaissance were, by comparison to their earlier medieval counterparts, marvels of engineering and metallurgy. Advanced techniques and access to better quality steel allowed for longer blades to be made of less metal without losing strength. Centuries of war and preparing for war gave us a wealth of knowledge about what worked on the battlefield \u2013 and what didn\u2019t. Advancements in bladesmith skill, built on the generations that came before, informed better and more refined techniques. With the benefit of those centuries of experience and more, we are pleased to bring you the latest generation of Renaissance-inspired swords.\n\nThe Darksword Armory Medici Two-Handed Sword is inspired by the spirit of the Renaissance. The inspiration for this piece was the surviving examples of the Oakeshott Type XVIIIb, and to those familiar with this typology the lineage is clear in the long, slender design. The first component that catches the eye is the scentstopper pommel, a hallmark of many Renaissance swords of similar style and an effective counterweight for longer blades. Moving upward, a shapely leather-wrapped grip leads to a slender and simple guard that evokes the image of a soldier\u2019s weapon. The long, double edged blade is stiff and resilient, made all the more robust by the diamond cross section that reinforces its design. Of course, the 5160 steel alloy certain helps \u2013 like all our swords this steel provides excellent an excellent foundation for a tough yet pliant weapon.\n\nItalian sword schools \u2013 surely among the greatest in Europe \u2013 often focused on proper technique and control, and it is here that the Darksword Armory Medici excels. The long grip provides ample room for a two-handed grip and allows for full force to be applied to sweeping blows \u2013 or for precise control when aiming for gaps in an opponent\u2019s armor. Handling this sword is a true pleasure, and its blade presence is such that it feels ready to move into the next stance or cut. This sword may not be a cathedral, but it was made in the same spirit of innovation that caused the House of Medici to reshape Europe \u2013 we hope you will feel that spirit when it is in your hands.\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100%;\"><iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIGjrzukhX8\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;</iframe></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100%;\"><iframe style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dnfaZDFtMA\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;</iframe></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100%;\"><iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>",

The long, slender blade is rendered a strong thrusting weapon due to the diamond cross-section, allowing it to slip between plates of armor and split rings of mail. Yet the reasonable point-of-balance and extended, leather-wrapped handle create a weapon that flows smoothly through guard, cut, and thrust, not limiting it to a single style of offence. The gracefully curved guard and scentstopper pommel complement the simple and straightforward blade, and everything is polished to a mirror sheen. The Medici, named for the Italian political dynasty that were for a time the de facto rulers of Italy, is a beautiful weapon that deserves to be a centrepiece in your home.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SPECS:\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Total Length : 51\u201d</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Length: 38.5\u201d&nbsp;\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">grip: 9\"\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Width: 2 1/16\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Crossguard Length: 9\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Guard Depth: 7/8\u201d</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Weight: 3 lbs 5oz.&nbsp;\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">P.O.B.: 5 \u00be\u201d</span></p>",

Tolkien was writing The Silmarillion, he had several goals. One of them was to write an alternative, fantasy-laden history of Europe (in general) and Britain (in specific). Another was to bring to life many of the rich stories that grew in his own mind as he was immersing himself in ancient Anglo-Saxon texts. But most of all he wrote the book, and all his books, to provide a context for the Elven languages he invented. And in order to do that, he had to write an extensive history full of great characters, great deeds, and fell dangers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-48927\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ringil.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"1083\">Among earliest of these stories are the tales of the first Elves, who awoke in Middle Earth when only stars lit the world. In the days before the Sun and the Moon Middle Earth was watched over by the Valar, gods of Middle Earth who served the Creator Iluvatar. The Valar assisted in the creation of the world and waited for the Children of Iluvatar (Humans and Elves) to awaken. However, they were not alone - also in Middle Earth was Morgoth, a dark Valar who wished not to serve but to rule. The Valar lived far to the West on the great Ilse of Valinor, whereas Morgoth was in hiding in Middle Earth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">When the first Elves awoke they called themselves the Quendi \u2013 meaning the Speakers, as they were the only beings they knew of who spoke. When the Valar, gods of Middle-Earth, realized that the Elves had come into being they knew that they would be vulnerable to danger. Indeed, when Morgoth realized the Elves had awoken he set out to capture as many of them as he could, using his dark magics to twist them into becoming Orcs. The Valar responded by sending an envoy to invite the Elves to come and dwell with them in Valinor. Many Elves joined them on the long journey to Valinor including Finw\u00eb, who would become Lord and King of the group of Elves known as the Noldor. Finw\u00eb was father to a number of powerful elves including F\u00ebanor, creator of the Silmarils. When Finw\u00eb was killed by Morgoth F\u00ebanor and his brothers Fingolfin, Finarfin, and Findis swore revenge and followed Morgoth back to Middle Earth. Of these brothers Fingolfin was the greatest in terms of strength of arms and valour, and after F\u00ebanor\u2019s death Fingolfin would become High King of the Noldor. Fingolfin would lead the Nolder to lay siege to Morgoth\u2019s fortress of Angband for over four centuries, as well as expand the power and control of the Elves in Middle Earth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">If the siege had held Middle Earth may have had lasting peace, but during the intervening four hundred years Morgoth was not idle. In a day known as the Dagor Bragollach or Battle of the Sudden Flame, Morgoth sent forth the full force of his strength \u2013 Balrogs, dragons, and uncountable numbers of Orcs</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">poured out, while mountains cracked and spewed forth vast rivers of magma. Whole kingdoms were wiped off the face of the earth, and while Fingolfin\u2019s fortress survived the might of the Noldor had been brought to ruin. The loss of his people was too much for him to bear, and the greatest warrior of all the Elves went to war.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Now news came to Hithlum that Dorthonion was lost and the sons of Finarfin</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">overthrown, and that the sons of Feanor were driven from their lands. Then</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Fingolfin beheld (as it seemed to him) the utter ruin of the Noldor, and the defeat</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">beyond redress of all their houses; and filled with wrath and despair he mounted</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">upon Rochallor his great horse and rode forth alone, and none might restrain</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">him. He passed over Dor-nu-Fauglith like a wind amid the dust, and all that</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">beheld his onset fled... Thus he came alone to Angband\u2019s gates, and he sounded his horn, and</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">smote once more upon the brazen doors, and challenged Morgoth to come forth</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">to single combat. And Morgoth came.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">&nbsp;</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">That was the last time in those wars that he passed the doors of his stronghold,</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">and it is said that he took not the challenge willingly; for though his might was</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">greatest of all things in this world, alone of the Valar he knew fear. But he could</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">not now deny the challenge before the face of his captains; for the rocks rang</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">with the shrill music of Fingolfin\u2019s horn, and his voice came keen and clear</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">down into the depths of Angband; and Fingolfin named Morgoth craven, and</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">lord of slaves. Therefore Morgoth came, climbing slowly from his subterranean</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">throne, and the rumour of his feet was like thunder underground. And he issued</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">forth clad in black armour; and he stood before the King like a tower, iron-</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">crowned, and his vast shield, sable unblazoned, cast a shadow over him like a</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">stormcloud. But Fingolfin gleamed beneath it as a star; for his mail was overlaid</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">with silver, and his blue shield was set with crystals; and he drew his sword</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Ringil, that glittered like ice.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%;\">&nbsp;</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">From The Silmarillion, Chapter 18 - OF THE RUIN OF BELERIAND AND THE FALL OF FINGOLFIN</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The battle of Fingolfin and Morgoth is one of the greatest scenes in the Silmarillion, and perhaps all fantasy fiction. The fury and the despair, the triumph and the tragedy mingle together to create a perfect moment; we feel Fingolfin\u2019s rage and anguish, and Tolkien\u2019s beautiful prose as he describes the fight is not just text \u2013 it\u2019s art. We can see clearly in our minds eye the terrifying sight of Morgoth towering over the High King, who shines bright in the darkness with a mighty sword in his hand.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The Darksword Armory Ringil is an Elven sword of great renown. The long, single-edged blade is similar to Swiss designs of the 16th century with a stiff back and a curved tip, though our Elven sword had an exotic flared tip. The curving steel guard includes a finger guard, allowing the wielder to safely wrap a finger to improve their grip. The hardwood grip has been carved with Celtic knotwork reminiscent of the flowing designs of the Elves, which \u2013 when paired with the teardrop pommel \u2013 provides a striking contrast to the bright steel of the rest of the weapon. It is not hard to imagine this sword glittering like ice in the darkness.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Hand-and-a-half or bastard sabres are known for their agile handling, and the Ringil is no exception. This sword has significant blade presence, and certainly feels like it could deal a mortal wound to a Dark Lord. Despite this, the long handle and solid pommel bring the point of balance down to a manageable range, allowing this sword to flow effortlessly through drills or in heated motion. The blade has no fuller, which allowed us to include an Elven inscription in the Tengwar script: \u201cThe slightest crack will permeate light even in the darkest corners of the realm.\u201d This hopeful message exemplifies the mission and the burning purpose of Fingolfin and the mighty Noldor kingdoms.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIGjrzukhX8\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dnfaZDFtMA\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>",

Tolkien\u2019s The Silmarillion, the Darksword Armory Ringil is a European-style sabre with a fantasy twist. In the ancient history of Middle Earth, Ringil was carried by the elven High King Fingolfin, the most valiant warrior who ever lived. One of the few named weapons in Tolkien\u2019s works, Ringil was used by Fingolfin in his epic single combat against the Dark Lord Morgoth. This deadly Elven blade gave the Dark Lord wounds from which he never recovered. Our version of Ringil is single-edged, as were many of the Elven weapons of the Second Age depicted in the Peter Jackson Fellowship of the Ring prologue. A hand-and-a-half sabre, this sword is similar to 16th century Swiss designs \u2013 with a fantasy twist. With excellent handing, a carved hardwood handle, and Elven script on the blade this sword sits comfortable at the intersection of deadly and beauty.</span></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 80%;\">SPECS:</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Total Length : 46\u201d</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Length: 34\u201d\ngrip: 8.5\"\nBlade Width: 2 \u201d\nCrossguard Length: 6\u201d\nGuard Depth: 7/8\u201d\nWeight: 3 lbs 13oz.&nbsp;\n</span></p>",

For centuries the Dark Lord Morgoth was under siege in Angband, and the Elves kept watch and grew in power. Many great cities were built and alliances were forged, and though the days of F\u00ebanor (greatest of the Elven smiths) were long past there were now new masters of anvil and hammer. Of these new masters E\u00f6l, born in Doriath during the siege of Angband, was without peer though proud and covetous. Among his many feats E\u00f6l created a metal known as galvorn, which was black as jet yet harder and more supple than steel. He made a suit of armor of the substance which he wore ever after; that plus his brooding demeanor caused him to be known as the Dark Elf. During this time he also forged the twin swords Anguirel and Anglachel from meteoric iron, and gave Anglachel to Thingol, King of Doriath. Anglachel was recognized to have a dark and violent spirit within it, similar to the heart of its maker. Indeed, E\u00f6l lived a relatively short life for an Elf \u2013 he was sentenced to death for murdering his wife when she and their son attempted to flee his wrath and control.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 105%;\">In the days after Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband \u2013 a battle known as the Dagor Bragollach (\"Battle of Sudden Flame\") \u2013 countless numbers of Elves were slain, and the survivors fought desperately to keep from being overwhelmed. Thingol, as many of the Elf lords, allied himself with humans; specifically, Men from the House of Hador. Had Thingol known that this noble House was under a curse by the Dark Lord to have all they attempted to do for good turn to ill himself he may have chosen differently \u2013 but he did not. Thingol even chose to foster the son of his human friend H\u00farin, the boy T\u00farin Turambar. T\u00farin grew in strength and renown, and Thingol loved his as his own \u2013 but T\u00farin was resented by some of the Elves of Doriath. Tragically, one an occasion when T\u00farin defended himself against assault by one of Thingol\u2019s subjects the Elf was accidentally killed, and before he could receive judgement or mercy T\u00farin went into exile in shame.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 105%;\">Having left the Elves behind T\u00farin fell in with a company of bandits and men of ill-repute \u2013 however, his time among the Elves had not left him idle. T\u00farin rose to the head of this company and forged them into a fighting force that defended the innocent humans and brought terror and death to the roving bands of orcs. While T\u00farin attempted to carve out a new destiny for himself Thingol dearly missed his adopted son and grieved his going out from Doriath. When Beleg Strongbow, an Elven warrior and dear friend of T\u00farin, asked leave of Thingol to seek out his friend Thingol not only granted him leave but gave him Anglachel to assist in his quest. Beleg joined T\u00farin and his band, and both felt great joy at being reuinited. They fought side by side, and all would have been well had T\u00farin not been betrayed by one of his band and captured. Beleg hunted down the orcs who took his friend and came upon T\u00farin in a moment of great need, lying tortured and senseless in the orc\u2019s camp. Beleg rejoinced to have found his friend alive and drew Anglachel to cut his bonds \u2013 but the curse of Morgoth was still upon the heir of H\u00farin. The Dark Elf\u2019s blade slipped in his hand and Beleg lay a shallow cut on T\u00farin\u2019s foot. Roused to sudden wakefulness, T\u00farin leaped up and seized the sword, striking down his friend. When he realized he had killed his dearest friend and ally T\u00farin was inconsolable, and fled with the sword to the underground Elven city of Nargothrond.</span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_48802\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"314\"]<img class=\"wp-image-48802 size-full\" style=\"color: #555555; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 15.12px;\" title=\"The Reforging of Anglachel by Alan Lee\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/forging-the-gurthang-sword-1553.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"492\"> The Reforging of Anglachel by Alan Lee[/caption]\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 105%;\">In Nargothrond T\u00farin hid his true name and nature from the Elves, though they recognized him as a warrior of peerless skill and power. He had Anglachel reforged and named the new </span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 105%;\">weapon Gurthang, \u201cIron of Death,\u201d and through his adventures with this sword he became known as The Mormegil (\u201cThe Black Sword\u201d). Gurthang, like Anglachel from which it was made, seemed to carry&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 105%;\">with it a dark and battle-hungry spirit. For years T\u00farin used Gurthang to carve a swath of destruction across Morgoth\u2019s forces, even slaying Glaurung the Father of Dragons in his final battle. As the story of T\u00farin Turambar is a tragedy we will not complete it here \u2013 you can find the full tale in The Children of H\u00farin by J.R.R. Tolkien. However, we can say that at the end of T\u00farin\u2019s life Gurthang is revealed to have not just a spirit but a personality \u2013 and in the only instance of a weapon speaking in Tolkien\u2019s works recalls with regret the unjust slaying of Beleg Strongbow.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 105%;\">The story of Turin is the last place in the Silmarillion we find Gurthang. However, though it was not included in the published text of the Silmarillion, we can tell you Tolkien intended a special fate for&nbsp;Gurthang. He wrote that at the Final Battle at the end of days T\u00farin would use Gurthang to destroy Morgoth forever \u2013 and bring final vengeance for the House of Hador and all the wrongs Morgoth has done to the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 105%;\">Though its blade is not black as was the sword of Turin, the Darksword Armory Gurthang is a powerful weapon that was inspired by the work of the Dark Elf E\u00f6l. The mild steel guard is inscribed with flowing Elven script, and its graceful lines contrast the rigid and resilient steel in which it was inlaid. The blackened hardwood handle evokes the memory of the Dark Elf that forged it, elegant knotwork reminiscent of Elven architecture as depicted in Lord of the Rings art and film. Together the guard and handle create an unmistakable Elven design that one would find at home in a variety of fantasy settings.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 105%;\">Any sword capable of slaying the Father of Dragons must be robust, and our version of Gurthang is no exception. A broad, double-edged blade compliments the elegant hilt furniture, and two fullers grace its length nearly up to the tip. The sword has noticeable blade presence, capable of devastating cuts while retaining structural integrity \u2013 but the length of the guard and the pommel\u2019s counterweight bring the point-of-balance back under 3 inches, giving the sword a deceptively lively feel in the hand. Should you find yourself facing down darkness in your life this sword is sure to be your faithful companion.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIGjrzukhX8\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>\n\n<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dnfaZDFtMA\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>",

It will not love the hand it serves, neither will it abide with you long.\"</em></span></p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 105%;\">The Gurthang is a sword inspired by a dark fate. In J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Silmarillion, the Gurthang is a meteoric iron sword originally forged by the Dark Elf E\u00f6l but made most famous in the hands of the tragic hero T\u00farin Turambar. Unlike other swords in Toliien\u2019s work Gurthang was said to have a personality, to rejoice in war and lament over the blood of the innocent. Countless orcs fell before its edge, and it was even used to slay the Father of Dragons. Our version of Gurthang is a two-handed longsword with a 32\u201d double-fullered blade. The curved guard with elven script and black hardwood grip \u2013 carved with elegant knotwork \u2013 show the weapon\u2019s Elven inspired heritage. The long handle and heavy pommel provide excellent leverage and bring the point of balance down close to the guard, giving this sword a lively presence. Holding it, one feels as though they too could face off against a dragon.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SPECS:\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Total Length : 44.5\u201d</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Length: 32\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">grip: 10\"\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Width: 2 1/16\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Crossguard Length: 10\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Guard Depth: 7/8\u201d</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Weight: 3 lbs 12oz.&nbsp;\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">P.O.B.: 2 \u00be\u201d</span></p>",

Starting in Germany and then Italy, sword masters such as Johannes Liechtenauer (late 14<sup>th</sup>c)&nbsp; and Fiore dei Liberi (c.1340-1420) trained students in the use of the sword, not on the battlefield but in the judicial duel against unarmored and armored opponents. With the type XVIII and its sub-types,. We see the development of a true cut-and-thrust sword and one of the most successful sword types in Europe. In a period where art, status and functionality was of prime importance, the XVIIIb Gothic sword was a coveted weapon of war and social status.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Rarely in art do we find simplicity and elegance as a single defining character of a piece.&nbsp; This is precisely what imbues the Gothic sword with its inherent beauty. Its deep graceful lines reflecting the artistic revival and Gothic architectural patterns of the day.&nbsp; The Gothic sword, inspired from the original formerly displayed at the <em>Landesmuseum</em> in Zurich (national museum ), was a long sword used by the elite aristocracy during the peek of full plated Armour.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/7HvgwtRt7ow\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5iWQJ-aI-0U?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\ufeff&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</iframe><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">As a response to the increasingly protective plate armor of the time, the type XVIII b two handed longsword became the most essential part of the medieval Knight\u2019s arsenal. The stiff diamond shaped hollow ground needle tip blade was not only capable of powerful cuts, but offered exceptional advantages with their keen ability to pierce through the ever developing plate armor. &nbsp;With its diamond shaped hollow ground cross-sectional blade, the Gothic sword is representative of the changing role of the sword on the battle battlefield.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Effective thrusting, it also retained a large measure of its earlier ancestor\u2019s cutting ability.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The simple, yet elegant simplistic geometry of the sword reflects&nbsp; the Gothic artistic revival that not only inspired blade smiths and <img class=\"alignleft wp-image-28865 \" title=\"original at the Landesmuseum\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1332-Gothic-sword-Landesmuseum.jpg\" alt=\"1332-Gothic-sword-Landesmuseum\" width=\"249\" height=\"546\">armorers but also architects and painters of the period. The deeply hollow ground blade and clean hexagonal guard and fishtail pommel reflect this artistic revival. Swords during this period were not only exceptionally engineered to precisely perform their primary function, but also reflected the artistic patterns and influences from the gothic architectural structures of the time. &nbsp;Typically, the pommels on the two handed swords of this period tended to be flaring or fluted in shape, and less pronounced&nbsp; then their earlier rounded or globular pommels. More artistic flare was given to each part of the sword, while preserving important functional characteristics of the hilt. Hence, the Two Handed medieval type XVIIIb longswords&nbsp; were not merely weapons of war, but beautifully crafted artistic pieces in their own right.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Hence, when making the Gothic long sword our vision was to create a medieval sword worthy of the nobility of the 15<sup>th</sup> century. We set to design the sword with refined clean lines, prevalent in the architecture and art of the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries, while preserving the historical character of the guard and fishtail pommel. &nbsp;While great importance was bequeathed to the elegance and the symmetry of the fittings, considerable attention was set on the blade\u2019s performance, flex and balance. &nbsp;These elements easily made the Gothic sword one of our staff\u2019s favorite swords. Not only for it\u2019s exceptional handling characteristics but also for it\u2019s elegance and simplicity.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Gothic long swords, classified as type XVIII b were exclusively&nbsp; used by the elite aristocracy, especially in Germany. Despite their clean and straight forward design, Type XVIII b swords were beyond the reach of the common fighter or hired mercenary.&nbsp; The owner of such a sword would be a man of great wealth such as a knight owning a considerably large land or a baron. &nbsp;Many paintings, wood cuts and other artwork of the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> century, such as Albrecht Durer\u2019s&nbsp; \u201cThe Knight and the Devil\u201d, illustrate important noble figures with type XVIII b swords by their side.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">As Oakeshott remarks in \u201cThe Sword in the age of Chivalry\u201d</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/?attachment_id=31314\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-31314\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-31314 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Durer-The-Knight-gothic-sword-340x340.jpg\" alt=\"Durer-The-Knight-gothic-sword\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\"></a>There are many of these swords, particularly in German collections, and many are to be seen in art, particularly German paintings of the period 1450-1520. Durer shows many examples which are well-known. The finest survivor of the type \u2013 indeed, perhaps the most lovely sword of any period or place \u2013 is in the Bareische National Museum in Munich.&nbsp; Not only has this sword absolute perfection of line and proportion, but its preservation is perfect, and the decoration of grip, pommel and cross is restrained and beautiful, admirably suited to the hilt it adorns.</em></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The Two Handed Gothic Sword, is our staff\u2019s top pick.

The historical home of the Anglo-Saxons, Britain was an incredibly challenging fortress to assault. Anyone wishing to make a concerted effort to invade the island would have to cross the English Channel with enough of a fighting force to subdue the not inconsiderable armies that could be raised from its inhabitants. Challenges with logistics, especially bringing food and other resources to support a large invading force, would make it difficult for any extended campaigns to be successful. And extended they would need to be - despite how it may seem to us now in the modern world, Britain is not a small island. Thus, for foreign invasion of the British Isles to be successful it would need to rely on decisive battles that both broke the defending forces and allowed a foothold to be gained by the invaders. And, on this Day in History in the year 1066, one such decisive battle occurred.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy as of 1035 CE, was like the rest of Normandy descended from Viking stock. For William, though, he had a special connection to his Viking ancestors \u2013 he was a descendant of Rollo Sigurdsson, first king of the Normans. Perhaps it was this lineage that led William to the decision to invade England; although certainly his relation to Edward the Confessor (childless king of England, and William\u2019s cousin) may have had something to do with it.\n\nSome historians even believe Edward promised to make William his heir, even if word had promised to do so at one point this is not a promise he kept. On his deathbed in January 1066 the English king named Harold Godwinson, a powerful English noble, as his heir. William responded in a way that would have made his ancestors proud, and in early autumn of the same year landed a massive invasion force on the southeast coast of Britain. He quickly advanced to Hastings and began laying the foundation for his victory (including building a fortress to safeguard his beachhead).\n\nKing Harold, still fighting to retain his crown against local unrest, chose to march south in haste with what soldiers he could gather. His army of infantry with archers supporting the foot soldiers arrived at Hastings on October 13th, facing off against the Normans the next day. William, by contrast, had brought primarily cavalry with more archers then infantry. Battle was joined in the morning continued until dark that day with neither side gaining a definitive upper hand. Both kings fought with their armies, and by some accounts William\u2019s horse died while he was fighting not once, not twice, but three times. The battle could have raged for days had not Harold been slain in the melee, with no clear account of how he fell. When the Anglo-Saxon forces realized their king was dead, their lines broke and they fled.\n\nWilliam would face only token resistance from then on, and would be crowned King of England on Christmas Day of that year. All of which happened because of the turning point at Hastings.\n\nThe Darksword Armory Hastings Sword is a bastard sword with a unique appearance. The cruciform guard is similar to most surviving examples of medieval swords for several centuries, and the thick wheel pommel (weighted to give the sword a nimble heft and swing) is close in design to other swords of the era. We chose a black leather wrap and scabbard to accent the bright, satin-finished steel. Where this sword stands out most, though, is in its blade design. Like similar swords from the Oakeshott Sub-Type XIIIa family, the Hastings has a long, broad, double-edged blade suitable for the cut-and-thrust combat of the 13th- and 14th- centuries. This sword, though, has crisp a double fuller that extends \u00be the length of the blade. This fuller gives the Hastings a distinctive, noble appearance, a cut above the standard arming sword of the average soldier.\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;",

The Battle of Hastings took place on October 14th 1066, and marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule in Britain as well as leading to the introduction of the common law.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-53943\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Warranty-Banner-434x800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"222\" height=\"410\">Hand forged from 5160 High Carbon Steel</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 115%; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Differential Hardened at a Rockwell of 60 at the Edge; 48-50 at the core.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 115%; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Fittings: Mild Steel</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 115%; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Handle: Leather Wrapped wood Core (oak)</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 115%; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Total length: 39\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 115%; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Blade length: 32\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 115%; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Blade width at base: 2 1/8\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 115%; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Grip Length: 5 inches</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 115%; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Weight: 2 lbs 14oz</span>",

It is unsurprising, therefore that one of the master swordsmen of this era availed himself of both traditions while he learned his craft, and passed on what he had learned in one of the oldest fencing manuals ever discovered. We are speaking of course of Fiore dei Libiri, author of Fior di Battaglia \u2013 The Flower of Battle.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Fiore was born in 1350 CE in the countryside of Northern Italy, a region known as Aquileia. A youth of noble birth, Fiore showed significant aptitude for all things martial in nature. From a young age he studied and trained in the art of the sword with fervor, seeking out masters of the German and Italian schools \u2013 a task made easier by his close location to the border of Germany. Sometime prior to the 1380\u2019s he had already made himself known as an expert in weaponry and battlecraft as he is reported to have been involved in military inspections and other matters during the Aquileian War of Succession. After this conflict ceased, he travelled and served as a teacher of the sword arts for decades, teaching pupils of the great Italian houses such as Giovannino da Baggio, Azzone di Castelbarco, and the famous mercenary Galeazzo Gonzaga of Mantua.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">A prolific traveler, Fiore never made his home in one place for long. This may have been due to the fact that he was continually seeking out greater masters to train with \u2013 and sometimes, being frustrated in these efforts. By his own report Fiore encountered several so-called \u201cmasters\u201d who he considered to have less skill than they should for his title. Fiore even dueled several of these men, never losing nor being injured in any of them. All the while he collected students and trained them in the arts, often preparing them for duels of their own.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Some time in the early 1400\u2019s, Fiore began writing his most famous work. Fior di Battaglia \u2013 \u201cthe Flower of Battle\u201d \u2013 was an illuminated manuscript detailing all manner of combat techniques. Unarmed wrestling, unarmed combat vs an armed opponent, dagger fighting, sword and buckler, fighting in and out of armor, polearms, sword and dagger, and fighting on and off of horseback. Fiore\u2019s 49-page work was incredibly detailed, even complex, showing every point of a technique \u2013 including multiple counters for said technique. Each technique is paired with a series of illustrations giving the reader a visual representation of how they should execute the techniques and counters. Four surviving copies exist of this exquisite text, some with more pages than others, and each of them incredibly precious. Fiore completed other writings, including the much shorter Trattato della scherma (\u201cTreatise on Fencing\u201d),</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">but The Flower of Battle is what he was best known for. Fiore was one of the masters who inspired swordplay for generations to come, even to the era in which this parrying dagger was made.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">In finding a name for our parrying dagger \u2013 based on a 1580-1620 CE German Main-gauche currently at the Royal Armouries, in Leeds \u2013 we could think of none better than Fiore dei Libiri. This parrying dagger has a slender blade with a short, blunt ricasso double fullers extending to the tip. The hexagonal pommel is similar to many such designs from the Renaissance period, matching many examples in museums and private collections. Like dueling weapons often had, we opted for a wire-wrapped grip most suitable for use with leather gloves when handling and practicing. The central feature of this design, though, is the swept-ring guard. Elegant and functional, this guard marks the Fiore as not only a dueling companion but as an important part of a noble\u2019s regalia. When paired with a rapier it would be a worthy companion and defender, and would also make a handsome decoration for a home office or mantlepiece. If you have no more room in your house for a sword, but might have room for a main gauche, consider adding the Fiore parrying dagger to your collection!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Total length: 17\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Blade : 11\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">weight: 1 lb 3 oz</span>",

Held in the off hand, the parrying dagger (or \u201cmain gauche\u201d) allowed duelists to fight two handed against each other. Skilled fencers would use the parrying dagger in conjunction with a rapier for maximum effect. As these daggers were as much a part of a gentleman\u2019s daily costume as they were for self defence they were often beautifully decorated as well as skillfully made. This design is based on a surviving late 16th, early 17th German example currently located in the Leeds Museum. It is named for master Italian fencer Fiore dei Libiri, author of Fior di Battaglia and Trattato della scherma.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">&nbsp;</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Total length: 17\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Blade : 11\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">weight: 1 lb 3 oz</span>",

These would at first have been nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers, though as agriculture led to the rise of cities and more stabilized, centralized cultures there would be individuals who sought to lead. Those who led larger groups of people could gather immense amounts of power, and when that power gained enough momentum to pass the boundary of generations it created a monarchy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Most records from early civilizations indicated monarchies were incredibly common, and typically follow the hereditary structure with the power passing from father to son. Many of these societies started in Mesopotamia or other areas close to the cradle of civilization, indicating monarchies were likely one of the first forms of human government. Monarchy swiftly spread from Humanity's</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">birthplace across the world, and everywhere it went it tended to have more or less the same characteristics.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">In a monarchy, the monarch - typically a king, though queens could also sometimes rule - was a member of a dynastic royal family in which power passed from parent to child and monarchs tended to rule from the death of the previous king until their own death. When the currently seated monarch would die, the rule of the city-state or nation would pass to their heir - typically the eldest male child. When the eldest male child was not the most suitable ruler, or if no male children were to be had, different systems of hereditary succession could be used to determine the identity of the next monarch within the royal extended family \u2013 a nephew, a cousin, even an older relative. For this reason tracing royal lines can be a great deal more complicated than simply looking at parent to child passage of power. Further complicating the transition of power could be competing claims for the throne, where multiple persons with historical ties to the reigning family may make claim to the throne upon the death of the ruler. This led to countless wars of succession across human history, so which resulted in entire branches of royal families being liquidated by prospective kings in order to secure their future rule.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Monarchies brought several benefits to nations, despite the top heavy concentration of power. One of the benefits was continuity of rule, as upon the death of the previous ruler the next ruler is believed to already be king \u2013 even if they have not yet ascended the throne. Another benefit of a monarchical government especially in the West (though it would certainly appear in different forms elsewhere in the world) was the concept of the Divine Right of Kings. This religious dogma legitimized the rule of monarch by establishing a belief system in which the king had been appointed by God to fulfill the role of ruler for his people. That is, God has specifically chosen this ruler for these people, and it is the responsibility of the people to follow their King as God's representative on earth. This has the added benefit of raising the king over the authority of any Earthly body of power, reducing or completely eliminating his accountability to anyone but god. With both politics and church behind the institution, monarchs ruled Europe for centuries almost without question.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Some kings were kinds and just, others were cruel and terrible \u2013 but both were mere mortals in the end, and those who took their so-called divine mandate to heart would accomplish some true good in the world. It would not be until the Age of Enlightenment that power would begin to transfer away from hereditary systems of absolute rule into the hands of the people without whom kings would have no power. Yet even to today, monarchs around the world continue to be heads of state.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">The Darksword Armory Monarch is inspired by the those kings who became the best that their office would allow. A true example of a 13th Century arming sword, the Monarch shows the fruits of the evolution of the arms and armors of the Middle Ages. As armors dating prior to the 13th century were most commonly composed of mail armor made to withstand early medieval period weapons, there was rapid development of greater forms of protection. By the mid-13th century however, the advances in protective gear inspired a corresponding change in blade geometry. Finely tapered blades, with very pointy tips now served to pierce the weak points in heavily armored foes. The Monarch has one of these blades, double-edged with a long fuller and weighted for cut-and-thrust combat. Its simple, classic curved guard provides an elegant compliment to the no-nonsense blade. It is the Brazil nut pommel, though, that sets this piece apart. A feature indicative of the 13th century arming sword, this is our best rendition of the Brazil nut pommel, and we believe it is a perfect match for the rest of the sword. May the Monarch be the sword you have been looking for to inspire you to achieve the best you can in this world!</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">&nbsp;</span>",

The type X was in common usage from the time of the Vikings throughout much of the middle ages, and is recognizable for its broad blade with full-length fuller. This version has a distinctive \u201cBrazil nut\u201d pommel, common to the mid-1200\u2019s and beyond but most clearly represented on the type X to type XI transitory blades. The Monarch has the long, tapered blade typical of the cut-and-thrust swords that evolved to counter the increasing advances made in armor protection, and the curved guard is consistent with the numerous surviving 13th century Brazil nut swords found in museums and collections. The Monarch is a classic design that will be a unique presence in any collection.\n\n<strong>SPECS</strong>\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-53943\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Warranty-Banner-434x800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"222\" height=\"410\">Hand forged from 5160 High Carbon Steel\nDifferential Hardened at a Rockwell of 60 at the Edge; 48-50 at the core.\nFittings: Mild Steel\nHandle: Leather Wrapped Wood Core\nTotal length: 38.5\u2033\nBlade length: 32\u2033\nBlade width at base: 2 1/8\u2033\nGrip Length: 4.75\" inches\nWeight: 3.0 lbs&nbsp;\nPOB: 5.5 inches",

Aphrodite had a notable role in various myths and legends, such as the story of her love affair with the Trojan prince Paris, which was a catalyst for the Trojan War. She was also closely associated with the city of Athens, where she had a temple called the Aphrodite Pandemos, which represented her role in public and civic life.\n\nAphrodite's influence extended beyond Greece, as she was widely worshiped throughout the ancient Mediterranean world. Her cults and temples were present in various cities and regions, and her worship often involved rituals and festivals celebrating love and fertility. Aphrodite remains a prominent figure in Greek mythology and continues to inspire artistic depictions and interpretations of love and beauty.\n\nSPECS:\nMaterial: Bonded Marble\nDimensions: 17.5\" H x 8\" wide x 10\" deep\nWeight: 22 lbs&nbsp;",

    "content": "There are few French symbols more recognizable than the fleur-de-lis. Since the time of antiquity the \u201clily flower\u201d has represented the authority of the Crown and Royal Family of France. Legend in France states that the fleur-de-lis represents a Lily given to Clovis, King of the Franks, at his baptism by the spirit of the Virgin Mary. 300 years later the fleur-de-lis was prominent on the banner of the king when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. While other c countries (notably Albania and Italy), the symbol became strongly associated at that time with both the hereditary rulers of France and the predominance of the Catholic Church in the French court and aristocracy. Due to the commonplace acceptance of the Divine Right of Kings, the fleur-de-lis thus was a powerful reminder of the sovereignty of the French Royal Family.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">While color and style of the fleur-de-lis could vary, the traditional coloration was gold lilies on a blue background. Indeed, Charlemagne\u2019s banner was said to have been in this style. Many French monarchs since</span>\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-52144\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/heather-shield-making.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1054\"> have used the fleur-de-lis in heraldic artistry, on shields, banners, and the like. It was depicted on the official coat of arms of France for centuries until the Advent of the French Revolution relegated it to history. Despite it falling out of use in its heraldic function, surviving examples do exist in stone and iron on buildings constructed over the centuries. As such, even to Modern people around the world the fleur-de-lis remains a symbol strongly associated with French history and culture.\n\nThe French Royal Shield bears three fleur-de-lis in a style first commissioned in 1376 by Charles V, now known as the France Modern. This representation was purportedly inspired by the Holy Trinity, and makes its appearance to this day in art and culture across France. This design was chosen due to its prominence on the French national flag for many years, and the gold-on-blue color was chosen in honor of Charlemagne and the many kings who came after. When paired with any sword from the High Middle Ages and onward, this shield makes a striking statement at the heart of a collection.\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "The form and function of the shield in medieval history is, like many other aspects of war, a story of evolution. As weapons increased in deadliness and versatility due to improvements in construction and materials, so too did the methods that we used to protect ourselves from those weapons. Many weapons were single-handed by design, which led to a natural use of the off-hand as a means of defense. The shield \u2013 a wooden or metal object gripped in the off-hand or strapped to the arm \u2013 could protect the user from slashing blades, crushing blows, even arrows. In many battles, having a well-made shield was as important as having a good weapon \u2013 if not more so. In countless cultures around the world, shields in one form or another make an appearance.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-52041\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Field-combat-shield-1758.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"600\">Early shields used by the Greeks and Romans were precursors of the medieval shield, and a variety of designs were utilized depending on the role of the soldier. Most famous of these was the scutum, the curved, rectangular shield of the Roman Legions. Both art and pop culture frequently depict Roman legions marching in ranks, holding their shields before them, moving as a single, perfect military unit.\n\nVikings, too, engaged in a form of combat that revolved around the use of a shield. Viking shields were typically round and made of wooden planks, with a central metal boss that protected the hand. For Vikings, the shield was a weapon as well \u2013 and when edged with metal, could be devastating when punched into an opponent\u2019s face. Even when not being used to bludgeon enemies, the Viking shield was an effective and mobile tool for defense, allowing a Viking warrior to quickly strike and then retreat back to protection. Vikings would also paint symbols and spells on their shields \u2013 for protection, for guidance, and for prowess in battle.\n\nDescendants of the Vikings (via the \u201caggressive settling\u201d of Normandy) continued to develop the shield as weapons and combat in Europe evolved. Mounted combat, especially mounted combat using lances, combined with traditional round shields resulted in a mostly unprotected left flank. By extending the shield into an almond or a leaf shape, mounted fighters could protect themselves more effectively. The use of these shields became popular during the 11th century and was frequently depicted in art. They became so widely used that the First Crusade brought with it a veritable flood of kite shields \u2013 which influenced the design and use of shields throughout the middle east for centuries.\n\nWhat evolved from the Norman kite shield was what later became known as the medieval heater shield. As armor became more effective, shields could become smaller and more agile. The heater shields (later named this due to its resemblance to a clothes iron) were thus designed with mobility in mind. They could be used mounted or on foot and were thus incredibly versatile \u2013 both armored knights and footmen could pick up and incorporate a heater shield into their different roles. The heater shield was typically constructed from layers of thin wood in a curved triangle shape that maximized surface area (and therefore protection), covered in leather or canvas. These could be incredibly affordable, which meant they could be carried by both nobles and common soldiers.\n\nCustom Shield Request Note:\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">We can do the custom shield, however, we need a vector file with a 300 dpi format.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">The size of the image should be 21.333 inches in width x 26.458 inches in height.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">There are no returns on custom Shields.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">Please contact us by email for more information on this.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_37423\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-37423 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shield-front-2-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Medieval shield - front\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"> French Royal Shield (#1757) - front[/caption]",

    "content": "Most countries in Europe have complex histories when it comes to the ruling class. France is no exception. Long before the area now known as France resembled anything like the country we have today, kingdoms rose and fell and evolved into new territories with new rulers so frequently that there are entire textbooks dedicated to giving just a rough overview of the subject. However, there was a surprising level of continuity for the region of France for over 1400 years.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-52127\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/royal-french-shield-1759-medieval-french-monarchy-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"720\">The kingdom of France has its origins in the Old Kingdom of West Francia, also known as the Kingdom of the West Franks, established by Charlemagne in 843 CE. It was Charlemagne who used the fleur-de-lis at the symbol for this kingdom, part of a long tradition of this symbol\u2019s association with France. This kingdom would transition into the kingdom of France in the 10th century, ruled over by the Capetian Dynasty almost continuously for the next 800 years. A dizzying array of intermarriages, child kings, short-lived rulers who died under mysterious circumstances, and just as mysterious eras of peace created a tapestry with many interwoven threads throughout the history of France's monarchs. Some monarchs ruled for over 50 years. Some ruled for a few years or less. The shortest ruled for 5 days, certainly a record even for France\u2019s history. But the sheer continuity of the line of French kings is remarkable in the context of Western Europe, in which kingdoms changed hands as often as some kings changed wives.&nbsp;\n\nAnother piece of continuity for the long-lived Kingdom of France is the fleur-de-lis, which is featured here prominently on the Darksword Armory French monarch shield. The Capetian House had been using many gold lilies scattered across a blue background since the 13th century, and it is this design of the ruling dynasty of France that is depicted on the shield. Each fleur-de-lis is representative of that gold lily, long associated as a prominent symbol of French nobility. For a country that had such a continuous series of rulers in the same dynasty it makes sense that such a symbol would endure as long as it has. Students of French or European history will recognize this shield in your collection as representative of France\u2019s royal history.\n\nCustom Shield Request Note:\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">We can do the custom shield, however, we need a vector file with a 300 dpi format.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">The size of the image should be 21.333 inches in width x 26.458 inches in height.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">There are no returns on custom Shields.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">Please contact us by email for more information on this.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "The form and function of the shield in medieval history is, like many other aspects of war, a story of evolution. As weapons increased in deadliness and versatility due to improvements in construction and materials, so too did the methods that we used to protect ourselves from those weapons. Many weapons were single-handed by design, which led to a natural use of the off-hand as a means of defense. The shield \u2013 a wooden or metal object gripped in the off-hand or strapped to the arm \u2013 could protect the user from slashing blades, crushing blows, even arrows. In many battles, having a well-made shield was as important as having a good weapon \u2013 if not more so. In countless cultures around the world, shields in one form or another make an appearance.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-52130\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Medieval-shield-warfare-knight-shield-1760.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"1080\">Early shields used by the Greeks and Romans were precursors of the medieval shield, and a variety of designs were utilized depending on the role of the soldier. Most famous of these was the scutum, the curved, rectangular shield of the Roman Legions. Both art and pop culture frequently depict Roman legions marching in ranks, holding their shields before them, moving as a single, perfect military unit.\n\nVikings, too, engaged in a form of combat that revolved around the use of a shield. Viking shields were typically round and made of wooden planks, with a central metal boss that protected the hand. For Vikings, the shield was a weapon as well \u2013 and when edged with metal, could be devastating when punched into an opponent\u2019s face. Even when not being used to bludgeon enemies, the Viking shield was an effective and mobile tool for defense, allowing a Viking warrior to quickly strike and then retreat back to protection. Vikings would also paint symbols and spells on their shields \u2013 for protection, for guidance, and for prowess in battle.\n\nDescendants of the Vikings (via the \u201caggressive settling\u201d of Normandy) continued to develop the shield as weapons and combat in Europe evolved. Mounted combat, especially mounted combat using lances, combined with traditional round shields resulted in a mostly unprotected left flank. By extending the shield into an almond or a leaf shape, mounted fighters could protect themselves more effectively. The use of these shields became popular during the 11th century and was frequently depicted in art. They became so widely used that the First Crusade brought with it a veritable flood of kite shields \u2013 which influenced the design and use of shields throughout the middle east for centuries.\n\nWhat evolved from the Norman kite shield was what later became known as the medieval heater shield. As armor became more effective, shields could become smaller and more agile. The heater shields (later named this due to its resemblance to a clothes iron) were thus designed with mobility in mind. They could be used mounted or on foot and were thus incredibly versatile \u2013 both armored knights and footmen could pick up and incorporate a heater shield into their different roles. The heater shield was typically constructed from layers of thin wood in a curved triangle shape that maximized surface area (and therefore protection), covered in leather or canvas. These could be incredibly affordable, which meant they could be carried by both nobles and common soldiers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCustom Shield Request Note:\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">We can do the custom shield, however, we need a vector file with a 300 dpi format.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">The size of the image should be 21.333 inches in width x 26.458 inches in height.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">There are no returns on custom Shields.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">Please contact us by email for more information on this.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "During the tumultuous years known as the Middle Ages, many great military orders were founded. The Knights Templar, the Knights Hospitaller, the Order of Saint James, the Order of Calatrava, all had their origins during the time of the Crusades. The Teutonic Knights, also known as the Order of Brothers of the German House of St Mary in Jerusalem were one such order.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-52129\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/medieval-Crusader-shield-1761-knight-shield-armor.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"867\" height=\"1080\">During the Crusades, one of the most pivotal battles was the Siege of Acre. Led by Guy of Jerusalem, a knight who fought against Saladin himself, the siege ended in 1191 CE with the surrender of the Islamic forces and the retreat of Saladin's armies. It is said that King Richard himself accepted Saladin\u2019s surrender of the city. In the aftermath of the battle, German merchants took over a hospital in order to provide care to the sick and wounded. These merchants began calling themselves the Hospital of St Mary of the German House in Jerusalem. Their work became so famous that the Pope himself granted his approval, and the order began to grow. In 1197 after the death of Henry VI of Germany, German Crusaders began to leave the Holy Land in droves. This created an unacceptable vacuum of power, and a frenzied recruiting drive was engaged in by German Nobles and clergy alike. The Hospital of St Mary of the German House in Jerusalem became the fertile soil in which a new order of crusading knights would be planted, a military and monastic order inspired by the Templars and molded into a fighting force in the Middle East. Pope Innocent III granted them the symbol of a white field and black cross upon it, and the Teutonic Knights were born.\n\nThe Teutonic Knights were heavily active in the Middle East over the next century, but as they had been granted lands and titles in Europe to help establish their power their focus quickly shifted towards expanding those territories. The Teutonic Knights were granted significant autonomy to invade and conquer swaths of Europe in order to convert pagan people to Christianity, and they took up this cause with gusto. The Teutonic Knights would fight along the Transylvanian border of Hungary, against the pagan Prussians (even ruling areas of Prussia), and even an unsuccessful attempt to conquer Lithuania. It would be this last attempt that would break their military forces beyond repair, as the combined forces of Poland and Lithuania delve them a decisive defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410.\n\nThe Teutonic Order would decline in power continually over the next few centuries, giving up land and influence as its members dwindled and military prowess never recovered. Napoleon declared the order to be dissolved in 1809, though a few decades later it would be revived as a religious organization under the direction of the Catholic church. No longer a military force, the Teutonic order exists today as an organization joined by German to accomplish charitable activities- and in a throwback to their origins, works to fund medical clinics in low-income areas of the world.&nbsp;\n\nThe Darksword Armory Teutonic Shield is the historical symbol of the Teutonic knights. A black cross on a white field, this symbol would have been instantly recognizable for centuries anywhere in Eastern Europe as the sigil of the Teutonic Order. While their centuries long history\n\nwas tumultuous, the impact they had on Eastern Europe cannot be overstated. The Teutonic Shield would be an excellent addition to any collection for those who are interested in the history of the Crusades and the great military orders that they inspired.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCustom Shield Request Note:\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">We can do the custom shield, however, we need a vector file with a 300 dpi format.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">The size of the image should be 21.333 inches in width x 26.458 inches in height.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">There are no returns on custom Shields.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">Please contact us by email for more information on this.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_37421\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-37421 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shield-back-2-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Medieval Shield - back\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"> Medieval shield - back view[/caption]",

    "content": "The form and function of the shield in medieval history is, like many other aspects of war, a story of evolution. As weapons increased in deadliness and versatility due to improvements in construction and materials, so too did the methods that we used to protect ourselves from those weapons. Many weapons were single-handed by design, which led to a natural use of the off-hand as a means of defense. The shield \u2013 a wooden or metal object gripped in the off-hand or strapped to the arm \u2013 could protect the user from slashing blades, crushing blows, even arrows. In many battles, having a well-made shield was as important as having a good weapon \u2013 if not more so. In countless cultures around the world, shields in one form or another make an appearance.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-52128\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/medieval-templar-shield-crusader-knight-shield-1962.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"829\" height=\"1080\">Early shields used by the Greeks and Romans were precursors of the medieval shield, and a variety of designs were utilized depending on the role of the soldier. Most famous of these was the scutum, the curved, rectangular shield of the Roman Legions. Both art and pop culture frequently depict Roman legions marching in ranks, holding their shields before them, moving as a single, perfect military unit.\n\nVikings, too, engaged in a form of combat that revolved around the use of a shield. Viking shields were typically round and made of wooden planks, with a central metal boss that protected the hand. For Vikings, the shield was a weapon as well \u2013 and when edged with metal, could be devastating when punched into an opponent\u2019s face. Even when not being used to bludgeon enemies, the Viking shield was an effective and mobile tool for defense, allowing a Viking warrior to quickly strike and then retreat back to protection. Vikings would also paint symbols and spells on their shields \u2013 for protection, for guidance, and for prowess in battle.\n\nDescendants of the Vikings (via the \u201caggressive settling\u201d of Normandy) continued to develop the shield as weapons and combat in Europe evolved. Mounted combat, especially mounted combat using lances, combined with traditional round shields resulted in a mostly unprotected left flank. By extending the shield into an almond or a leaf shape, mounted fighters could protect themselves more effectively. The use of these shields became popular during the 11th century and was frequently depicted in art. They became so widely used that the First Crusade brought with it a veritable flood of kite shields \u2013 which influenced the design and use of shields throughout the middle east for centuries.\n\nWhat evolved from the Norman kite shield was what later became known as the medieval heater shield. As armor became more effective, shields could become smaller and more agile. The heater shields (later named this due to its resemblance to a clothes iron) were thus designed with mobility in mind. They could be used mounted or on foot and were thus incredibly versatile \u2013 both armored knights and footmen could pick up and incorporate a heater shield into their different roles. The heater shield was typically constructed from layers of thin wood in a curved triangle shape that maximized surface area (and therefore protection), covered in leather or canvas. These could be incredibly affordable, which meant they could be carried by both nobles and common soldiers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCustom Shield Request Note:\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">We can do the custom shield, however, we need a vector file with a 300 dpi format.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">The size of the image should be 21.333 inches in width x 26.458 inches in height.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">There are no returns on custom Shields.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">Please contact us by email for more information on this.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "The form and function of the shield in medieval history is, like many other aspects of war, a story of evolution. As weapons increased in deadliness and versatility due to improvements in construction and materials, so too did the methods that we used to protect ourselves from those weapons. Many weapons were single-handed by design, which led to a natural use of the off-hand as a means of defense. The shield \u2013 a wooden or metal object gripped in the off-hand or strapped to the arm \u2013 could protect the user from slashing blades, crushing blows, even arrows. In many battles, having a well-made shield was as important as having a good weapon \u2013 if not more so. In countless cultures around the world, shields in one form or another make an appearance.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-52048\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1765-Royal-English-Shield.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"593\" height=\"712\">Early shields used by the Greeks and Romans were precursors of the medieval shield, and a variety of designs were utilized depending on the role of the soldier. Most famous of these was the scutum, the curved, rectangular shield of the Roman Legions. Both art and pop culture frequently depict Roman legions marching in ranks, holding their shields before them, moving as a single, perfect military unit.\n\nVikings, too, engaged in a form of combat that revolved around the use of a shield. Viking shields were typically round and made of wooden planks, with a central metal boss that protected the hand. For Vikings, the shield was a weapon as well \u2013 and when edged with metal, could be devastating when punched into an opponent\u2019s face. Even when not being used to bludgeon enemies, the Viking shield was an effective and mobile tool for defense, allowing a Viking warrior to quickly strike and then retreat back to protection. Vikings would also paint symbols and spells on their shields \u2013 for protection, for guidance, and for prowess in battle.\n\nDescendants of the Vikings (via the \u201caggressive settling\u201d of Normandy) continued to develop the shield as weapons and combat in Europe evolved. Mounted combat, especially mounted combat using lances, combined with traditional round shields resulted in a mostly unprotected left flank. By extending the shield into an almond or a leaf shape, mounted fighters could protect themselves more effectively. The use of these shields became popular during the 11th century and was frequently depicted in art. They became so widely used that the First Crusade brought with it a veritable flood of kite shields \u2013 which influenced the design and use of shields throughout the middle east for centuries.\n\nWhat evolved from the Norman kite shield was what later became known as the medieval heater shield. As armor became more effective, shields could become smaller and more agile. The heater shields (later named this due to its resemblance to a clothes iron) were thus designed with mobility in mind. They could be used mounted or on foot and were thus incredibly versatile \u2013 both armored knights and footmen could pick up and incorporate a heater shield into their different roles. The heater shield was typically constructed from layers of thin wood in a curved triangle shape that maximized surface area (and therefore protection), covered in leather or canvas. These could be incredibly affordable, which meant they could be carried by both nobles and common soldiers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCustom Shield Request Note:\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">We can do the custom shield, however, we need a vector file with a 300 dpi format.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">The size of the image should be 21.333 inches in width x 26.458 inches in height.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">There are no returns on custom Shields.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">Please contact us by email for more information on this.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "The form and function of the shield in medieval history is, like many other aspects of war, a story of evolution. As weapons increased in deadliness and versatility due to improvements in construction and materials, so too did the methods that we used to protect ourselves from those weapons. Many weapons were single-handed by design, which led to a natural use of the off-hand as a means of defense. The shield \u2013 a wooden or metal object gripped in the off-hand or strapped to the arm \u2013 could protect the user from slashing blades, crushing blows, even arrows. In many battles, having a well-made shield was as important as having a good weapon \u2013 if not more so. In countless cultures around the world, shields in one form or another make an appearance.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-52118\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"672\" height=\"807\">Early shields used by the Greeks and Romans were precursors of the medieval shield, and a variety of designs were utilized depending on the role of the soldier. Most famous of these was the scutum, the curved, rectangular shield of the Roman Legions. Both art and pop culture frequently depict Roman legions marching in ranks, holding their shields before them, moving as a single, perfect military unit.\n\nThe area now occupied by the modern nation of Germany has had a long and varied history. However, prior to the wars of the 20th century, even prior to the unification of the German Empire in 1871, the nation-states that would make up modern Germany had many things in common \u2013 language, couture, and even rule under the Holy Roman Empire. It was during Roman rule that the Reichsadler \u2013 the Imperial Eagle \u2013 began to be commonly used on banners, seals, and coats of arms in this region.\n\nEagles as symbols for royalty is not an exclusively German invention; it is more likely to have been of Roman origin as the symbol on the standard of the Roman Legion was the Aquila (golden eagle). However, unlike other nations formerly under Roman rule which gravitated towards symbols such as the lion (England) or the fleur-de-lis (France), Germany maintained the use of the Imperial Eagle on coin, banner, seal, and shield for centuries. Fredrick II, Charles IV, and Charlemagne the Great all utilized eagles in their heraldic crests, and all of them bore resemblance to the Reichsadler that was in use into the 20th century. Now, the federal coat of arms of Germany is the Bundesadler \u2013 the Federal Eagle \u2013 and it is a black single-headed eagle on a golden field, clearly a descendant of its imperial ancestor.\n\nThe Darksword Armory German Shield depicts the two-headed black Reichsadler on a golden field, commonly associated as the coat of arms of Otto IV. King of Germany, ruler of the Welf dynasty, nephew of Richard the Lionheart, and Holy Roman Emperor, Otto IV (born 1175 CE) had an impressive resume by any measure. Yet he died deposed, dethroned, defeated, and excommunicated from the church at whose head he sat for nearly a decade. This downfall was made possible by a series of poor political and military decisions that nonetheless left Otto alive and able to retreat to his holdings, and his heraldic crest continued to be associated with Germany for centuries to come. This shield will be recognizable as having come from a long lineage of German royalty and nobility, and would be at home in any collection of European weapons.\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Custom Shield Request</strong></span> Note:\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">For custom shields, we require a high resolution vector or psd file (300 pdi).&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">The size of the image should be 21.333 inches in width x 26.458 inches in height.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">There are no returns on custom Shields.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">Please contact us by email for more information on this.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "Looking back on history, it is sometimes easy for those of us in the modern world to forget that surnames are relatively recent inventions. Even during the High Middle Ages the average person did not have a surname, and even those in the nobility or royal households might be known more by their title or the land they ruled over than a family name. It is for this reason that many people associate the title \u201cPendragon\u201d as the surname of King Arthur. In reality, though, not only was this unlikely to have been the mythical King\u2019s name in the early legends but the word may not have been a surname at all.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-52133\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/king-arthur-shield-1768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"609\" height=\"763\">In a majority of Arthurian legend, there are particular common events and themes woven throughout that can be considered \u201ccanon\u201d for the mythology - that is, as much as anything can be considered canon when we are speaking about legends. The sword Excalibur, removing said sword from the stone, the presence of the wizard Merlin, and the Kingdom of Camelot all find themselves as major events in the legends themselves. In one of the earliest texts of Arthurian Legend - the 12th century false history known as Historia regum Brittanniae - Arthur's father Uther is given the name Pendragon as his surname, and the author explains its meaning - \"The Dragon's Head.\" It would be much later (possibly as late as the 19th century) when this name would be attached to Arthur himself. It seems to fit the mythological king to have such a powerful name/title, but it is almost certainly a name that comes from an earlier Welsh word meaning literally \"chief dragon\" - figuratively, the title given to war-chiefs in ancient Wales. Given the probable Welsh origins of at least parts of Arthurian myth, this seems a likely origin for the term.\n\nDespite its uncertain history, the name Pendragon and the symbolic presence of a dragon in Arthur's coat of arms is yet another common thread in Arthurian myth. As early as the 9th century a gold dragon on a white background was purportedly the banner of King Arthur, and it is from this heraldry that Wales gets its own flag - the Red Dragon on a white and green field. The Darksword Armory King Arthur Shield is an homage both to Arthurian Legend and to the Welsh origins of that legend. When displayed with our Excalibur sword, it is a beautiful sight.\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "Of all the symbols used to represent the kingdom of England and the British empire, few are more iconic than the lion. A symbol of Bravery and valor, the lion has been associated with England since the time the 12th century. However, it's use as a symbol of nobility goes back to the late Norman nobility that accompanied William the Conqueror on his invasion of the British Isles. Thus, it is safe to conclude that the lion as a symbol for Britain's might and royal power has its origins in Normandy. This may seem unusual as the lion is not native to England, however as the kingdom of England Drew many of its Inspirations and symbolism from the Bible the frequent appearances of lions to represent the power and majesty of God (i.e. \"The Lion of Judah\") was a natural connection for the British to make.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-52122\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Henry-V-Shield-Medieval-monarchy-kite-shield-1769.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"627\" height=\"752\">The earliest date when Lions became associated with the English Royal House is not precisely known. However, what is known is that no later than 1128 CE Henry I was granting badges to family depicting lions in a coat of arms. Members of the British Royal Family used lions in their heraldry, and according to some sources Henry II had two lions as His official emblem until his death in 1189. It would be Richard the Lionheart, though, who would first bear three lions on his personal coat of arms, on his shield, and on what would come to be known as the Great Seal of Richard I - three gold lions on a blood red field. This coat of arms would come to be associated with England so strongly that to this day this symbol appears on official English Royal seals and as the official Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Great Seal of Richard the Lionheart served as the inspiration for our Richard I shield. Three golden lions now grace this coat of arms, in a style known to heraldry experts as three lions passant guardant. This design would be instantly recognizable as being associated with the famous crusader king, and would be at home paired with any of our High Middle Ages one-handed arming swords.\n\n.\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "&nbsp;\n\nHuman beings are natural storytellers, whatever the age in which they happen to live. Even in the time before television, movies, and comic books, we were still an inventive and creative people, and one need look no further than medieval myth and legend for example. Countless creatures from medieval lore Grace tapestries, paintings, arms and armor despite the fact that they existed nowhere in nature. And of these mythical creatures, perhaps none are better examples of courage and Majesty than the Gryphon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-52123\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1770-Teutonic-shield-medieval.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"609\" height=\"731\">\n\nGryphons (also spelled Griffen and Griffon) were mythological creatures with origins in ancient antiquity, possibly as early as the fourth millennia BCE. The earliest depictions were simply winged lions, though other versions in ancient Sumeria were eagles with the heads of lions. What all Gryphons seem to have in common is a combination of the king of birds and the king of beasts - the eagle and the lion - into a single creature capable of flight and ferocious battle. Gryphons appeared in art from ancient Mesopotamia, the Akkadian empire, the Persian empire, Egypt, Greece, Rome, and even areas of Central Asia. While this is a remarkable continuity of mythology, it should be noted that many of these dynasties succeeded one another and carried over significant amounts of culture, and trade between all of these areas was common for many centuries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGryphons in there many appearances were generally considered to be of mere human intelligence if not Superior, and were especially majestic and noble. Gryphons were known as fierce defenders and were often depicted as watching over gateways and passages as guardians. This led to their incorporation in Medieval Europe as signs and sigils of noble families, knights, military units, even being included in fashion and art. While there are many variations, most commonly in the Medieval period they were depicted as lions with the heads and foreclaws of eagles, and wings folded in relief or unfurled in flight. Gryphons have made their way into modern popular culture, being found in role-playing games and fantasy movies of all kinds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis shield depicts a black Gryphon rampant on a stable field, clearly a defensive or protective posture. The wings are not visible in this particular design, though the clawed eagle forelegs and beak contrasting with the hind quarters of the lion are clear. This shield would have been a simple classic design for any night taking to the field and seeking to make a name for themselves in battle - possibly as a defender of others like the Gryphon they bore.\n\n<strong>Custom Shield</strong>&nbsp;\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">We can do the custom shield, however, we need a vector file with a 300 dpi format.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">The size of the image should be 21.333 inches in width x 26.458 inches in height.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">There are no returns on custom Shields.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">Please contact us by email for more information on this.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "Even though many wars have been fought in the name of religion, more than most wars of the last two thousand years the Crusades are the most widely acknowledged example of a holy war \u2013 so much so that when we talk about a cause in which someone strongly believes, we often call it a Crusade. By themselves the Crusades might seem like unremarkable conflicts \u2013 after all, there had been wars in the Holy Land for centuries before they started (if not longer).\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-52135\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crusader-shield-templar-knight-armor-1771.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1047\" height=\"698\">What made the Crusades unique was two things. First, was the breadth of support from multiple conflicting nations in coming together to support a single cause- perhaps the first time in which so many across Christian Europe had united in favor of a unified goal. Second, was the sustained recurrence of their initiation - that is, there were multiple Crusades sanctioned by the Roman Catholic Church over a period of several centuries directed towards the liberation and control of Jerusalem and the surrounding territories. Beginning in the late 11th century and extending well into the 13th century at least, the Crusades were campaigns to \u201cfree\u201d the Holy Land from Islamic control initiated by the church and supported financially and militarily by the fighting forces of multiple Nations. In 1095 CE, Pope Urban II proclaimed the Crusades at the Council of Claremont, which kicked off a rush of supporters to their banners. Ostensibly an \u201carmed pilgrimage\u201d to the City of God, Crusaders were granted broad liberty to loot, pillage, and slaughter their way to the walls of Jerusalem. Even better, participants in these Crusades were considered to be engaging in acts of penitence while they did so, and according to Urban would therefore earn their salvation and forgiveness for sins committed along the way. This may have resulted in a campaign of violence not only against Islamic forces but against anybody they met along the way, including the slaughtering of German Jewish communities during the Rhineland massacres in 1096 and multiple other atrocities.\n\nAs thess were conflicts supported and directed by the Christian church, many who participated considered it to be a holy calling to join in the fray. As a result, the symbolism chosen by the Crusaders often trended towards Christian or biblical symbolism. Multiple versions of the Christian cross, for instance, were developed with different artistic flares and cultural implications. One of these crosses was the Jerusalem Cross, in which four crosses are placed in quadrants around a larger cross shape. Occasionally, the crosses that make up the Jerusalem Cross may be in the stylized form known as the cross potent, or crutch cross- simply put, crosses with equal lengths all round, and with bars at the ends of each arm. This Crusaders Shield is designed with the Jerusalem cross as it's inspiration. Four stylized crutch crosses are depicted in alternating black and white quadrants, dividing the shield in four around the central focal point. This would have been a design recognizable on the battlefield as belonging to a Crusader, and while those times are thankfully long past we hope you can appreciate the artistry that went into the design.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Custom Shields:</strong>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">We can do the custom shield, however, we need a vector file with a 300 dpi format.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">The size of the image should be 21.333 inches in width x 26.458 inches in height.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">There are no returns on custom Shields.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">Please contact us by email for more information on this.</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\"><span style=\"font-family: Garamond,times new roman,serif; font-size: large;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(34, 34, 34)\" data-ogsb=\"white\">&nbsp;</div>\n&nbsp;",

Odin, Tyr, Freya, all of these legendary characters are a part of our cultural lexicon. Even people who know relatively little about Norse mythology are aware that Odin carries a spear and is missing an eye. And who could forget Thor? Owing to one of the best PR campaigns in godly history (courtesy of Marvel comics), few people on earth would not recognize Thor, god of thunder, with his mystical hammer Mjolnir and his mighty strength in battle... even if you mostly recognize the comic book version.\n\nHowever, there are many lesser-known gods from the Norse age. Some of these still make their way into fiction in one form or another, though their stories may be drastically changed as a result. Others are even more obscure, yet their impact on Norse history can\u2019t be denied \u2013 such as the god Forseti, called the law giver, and who you probably have never heard of. Despite his modest position in Norse mythology, though, he may be one of the most impactful gods of all.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nStudy history long enough and you will notice an interesting feature common in almost every culture - the law comes from above. Human beings are created or emerge or otherwise find themselves to exist on planet earth, and at some point some god somewhere tells us how we ought to be living our lives. Setting aside the truth or fiction of these accounts, it is curious how every culture seems to come up with the same idea - that of establishing rules for all of us to follow based on some divine mandate. It's almost as though we feel that the idea of Justice or fairness is so important to our identity as a species that we are compelled to create fictions to justify their importance. For the Norse people, these laws came from Forseti.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nForseti appears in few places in the major writings of Norse history. He is first described in the Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l, a section of the Poetic Edda, and in this he is described as living in the great hall Glitnir, from which he settles disputes in accordance with a law of justice and fairness. In other epic tales Forseti appears with a great golden axe, in one case to 12 Viking leaders who had been a drift on the ocean without oars or food. These Vikings prayed for guidance and Forseti appeared; bearing a gleaming axe, he paddled their boat to shore, split the land open to create a spring of fresh water, and taught them the Code of Law as well as the means of dispensing justice in society. In modern times, pagans considered Forseti to be a god of negotiation and\n\ndebate, a just arbiter from an age of vendettas and vengeance who chooses to lead people to peaceful reconciliation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis axe is named in the spirit of this god of justice and reconciliation. The Lawgiver is a bearded Viking axe with incredible handling. Unlike the hulking, brutish axes of fantasy and fiction the Lawgiver is a nimble weapon that comes alive in the hand, able to be swung at length with one or both hands with equal deftness. The hardwood handle is wrapped in leather and treated to resist the elements, and compliments the darkened steel of the head. The head itself has a inlaid Viking knotwork design, the intricate swirls depicting the same dragon that would grace the prow of Viking longships. To add to the Lawgiver\u2019s versatility, the back of the head is a broad, flat face suitable for use as a hammer should the need arise. We hope you will find a place for the Lawgiver in your collection!\n\nAxe Head Material: 1095 Steel\nHandle Material: Ash Wood\nTotal Length : 35\u201d\nAxe head 7.5\" x 5 3/4\"\nAxe material: High Carbon steel\nweight: 3.2 lbs",

So named for Forseti, Norse god of justice, fairness, and reconciliation, the Lawgiver is a bearded Viking axe with beauty and presence. The head of this axe is decorated with Viking knotwork, a savage design reminiscent of the dragon figureheads on Viking longships. The dropped edge of the axe head creates a longer cutting edge while reducing the weight.

We are very proud of this axe. It is light, versatile, beautifully made and most importantly, destructive !&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nYou can't read about Norse mythology without coming across the concept of Ragnar\u00f6k. A catastrophic, world ending conflict, Ragnar\u00f6k is the pinnacle event of Viking mythology and features in multiple versions of surviving legends. Not only will the world perish in fire as a result of this climactic battle, but multiple Viking gods- including Odin, Loki, Heimdall, Thor, and Tyr - are fated to meet their end. Ragnar\u00f6k literally means \u201cThe Twilight of the Gods,\u201d and the gods have known it is coming for thousands of years.\n\nBesides the Norse gods we know and love, other figures feature in this legend. One is the Midgard serpent J\u00f6rmungandr, who threatens to Devour the world and is killed by Thor - though the god of thunder loses his life as a result. Another character who appears that plays a role of great importance is Fenrir, the Great Wolf and offspring of Loki, who is fated to bring catastrophe upon the world.\n\nIn the Norse writings Poetic Edda and Prose Edda, Fenrir's place in the final days are described. A prophecy given to the Gods describes how Fenrir would devour the Sun, beginning Ragnar\u00f6k, and slay Odin himself - which should be an indication of how deadly the creature is. In chapter 25 of the Prose Edda Fenrir is lured by the Gods into a trap designed to prevent him from beginning Ragnar\u00f6k. Fearing Fenrir\u2019s growing strength and seeking to delay the beginning of the Twilight of the Gods, the gods praised Fenrir\u2019s great strength and invited him to test it against some magical bindings they had designed. While he broke the first two with ease, Fenrir distrusted the Gods and when the third binding was brought to him would only submit to test it should one of the gods place their right hand into his jaws. Only Tyr was brave enough to do so, and when the third binding prove to be unbreakable Fenrir bit down and took the god's hand. Ever after Tyr would go one handed, and Fenrir remains bound until the ending of the world.\n\nDespite the fact that Fenrir is according to myth currently unable to harm the gods or the world, the future that awaits us should this great wolf escape is far from ideal. Fenrir will have grown to great size and ferocity in his captivity, his upper jaw touching the sky and his lower jaw reaching to the Earth. After devouring the sun and the father of the gods, Fenrir will only be defeated when Odin's son Vithar - god of vengeance - grips the wolf's jaws and rips him in half with all the strength of his rage and grief. The Earth will appear once again, joined by the surviving gods and two humans who will repopulate the world. Rising in the east, the daughter of the sun will take her place in the sky to give the world light and lead it into a future free of war and pain.\n\nThe Darksword Armory Fenrir axe is inspired by this dark yet hopeful tale. Unlike our shorter axes this is a true war axe, nearly 4 ft from end to end. The hardwood handle is extended to provide extra reach and torque for powerful, helmet splitting blows. Leather wrap on the mid-handle improves the grip, while the tapered end of the handle creates a comfortable place for extending the reach of the weapon. The head of the axe is carefully inscribed with the visage of a ferocious wolf depicted with Norse knotwork, certainly one of our most beautiful axe designs. The steeply dropping edge of the bearded axe head creates a cutting edge nearly a foot long, which went backed by the significant weight of the weapon is truly fearsome. By bringing this axe into your home, you bring a piece of legend with it - while we sit and wait for the sun devourer, it will surely keep you safe.\n\nTotal Length : 47\u201d\nViking Axe head (width): 9\u201d\nViking Axe head (height) 12\u201d long\nWeight: 4 lbs. 12 oz.",
    "excerpt": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 250%;\">The Fenrir Viking Axe</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">*NEW*</span> This is our most recent Norse Viking Axe. We are very proud of this axe. It is light, versatile, beautifully made and most importantly, destructive !&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe Fenrir Viking axe is named after the ancient wolf from Norse mythology who will usher in Ragnar\u00f6k and the end of all things. A bearded axe with a deep dropped point, the Fenrir is one of our latest designs and is deeply inspired by Norse history and prophecy. The stained wood handle is wrapped in leather and treated to resist the elements, and the leather wrap is riveted at multiple points along the handle. Intricate knotwork depicting a wolf's head is inlaid into the metal of the axe. The full length is nearly 4 ft long, and this hefty weapon certainly needs the reach - it promises to deliver devastating blows should the need arise. For fans of Viking myth and legend, or even just fans of Viking aesthetic and weaponry, the Fenrir acts is fit for a chieftain.\n\nTotal Length : 47\u201d\nViking Axe head (width): 9\u201d\nViking Axe head (height) 12\u201d long\nWeight: 4 lbs. 12 oz.",

And it\u2019s true \u2013 Oakeshott literally wrote the book on medieval sword types, and a whole system of classification (The Oakeshott Typology) is named after him. More advanced collectors may recognize the names Dr. Jan Peterson (1887-1967), who created a typology for classifying Viking swords, or Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (1890-1976), who refined Peterson\u2019s typology. Predating any of these scholars, however, is a man whose writing on medieval arms, armor, and architecture dwarfs many later historians\u2019 bibliographies \u2013 though he is largely unrecognized by the modern sword collecting world.\n\nEug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc was born in 1814 in Paris, France. He was an architect by trade, a brilliant one by all accounts, and an inspired artist and illustrator. While the architectural world knows Viollet-le-Duc as an architect, restorer of historical buildings and monuments (including considerable work on Notre-Dame Cathedral and many other famous landmarks), and as the first true theorist of modern architecture, he also wrote and illustrated some of the largest volumes in existence on the medieval sword.\n\nThe volumes Viollet-le-Duc wrote are breathtaking in their scope and depth. His extensive writings cover not only descriptions of different medieval swords and armor but tracks and explains their evolution throughout history, and his stunning illustrations compliment his writing expertly. Unfortunately, as his works were not commonly translated into English, the largely-anglophone sword collecting population remains ignorant of these incredible volumes and Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s influence on medieval scholarship. Some translations exist, but copies are notoriously hard to find and prohibitively expensive.&nbsp; In the English-speaking world, many of these works and completely unknown, and the incredible scholarship they contain can only be found by efforts of French-speaking individuals \u2013 such as us here at Darksword Armory.\n\nThe Duke dagger, being the companion dagger to our Duke sword,&nbsp; is inspired by an illustration in Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc medieval encyclopedia, a masterwork of exposition and illustration. A classic knightly design , the Duke bares the traditional cruciform guard so often found in medieval art. The straight guard is expertly sculpted and subtle in its smooth lines.&nbsp;\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel\nTotal Length: 17.5\u201d\nBlade Length: 12\u201d\nWeight: 1 lb.\nPOB: at the guard.",

Most people in Western culture who have been exposed, even tangentially, to historical fiction are aware that a knight follows a code of honor, and may even know its name: Chivalry. Most people are probably aware that knights wear full plate armor to ride into battle or the joust. They would also be aware that knights we not born, but made, in a ceremony involving a sword being tapped on their shoulders \u2013 and some may even know that before knights undergo this ceremony, they are known as something else \u2013 squires.\n\nThe process to become a knight was this: a noble-born boy, younger than 10 years old, would be put into service learning manners, etiquette, art, weapons, and about the essential duties of knights in society. At a certain age \u2013 usually 13 or 14 \u2013 the age would graduate to become a squire, or a knight-in-training. The squire would be apprenticed to a knight, and at this point their true training would begin. The squire would help the knight care for his armor, horse, and weapons, wait on their personal needs, and generally support them as staff on a daily basis. The knight, in turn, would train the squire in the arts of war needed to be an effective combatant on the battlefield. In fact, some squires would even accompany their knights into battle, defending them and learning to wage war in the most hands-on way possible. And, when they were ready, the squire would take his final step toward becoming a knight.\n\nThe Accolade \u2013 that holy ceremony in which a young man died to their old self and was \u201creborn\u201d symbolically as a knight \u2013 was a revered coming-of-age ceremony in the Middle Ages. The ceremony itself was relatively simple: at the age of 21 a squire would undergo a ritual cleanse on the eve of his knighting ceremony, then stay awake the entire night in a prayer vigil. In the morning, the squire would take his vows of obedience to his lord and to the Church, and he would arise from his knees a knight. The knight would go on to act in service, to display courtesy to ladies, and to be a force for good in the world for decades to come (at least, this was the ideal). As long as the knight was alive, though, he would always remember the squire he had once been.\n\nThe Squire dagger, companion to the Squire Sword,&nbsp; is designed with those apprentice knights in mind. A mid-length, double-edged blade crafted from tempered 5160 spring steel provides a durable and resilient striking edge. The blade has a 3/4 length fuller. The simple, curved guard sets this dagger apart from the standard cruciform hilt sword, and the wheel pommel is a classic design. What sets this dagger apart, is its handling. Weighing 1 lbs, the Squire is a startlingly fast and responsive dagger. In the hands of a growing apprentice knight, the Squire would be a suitable training or combat weapon; in your hands, it would be a lively dagger that begs to be put through its paces.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nBeing specifically designed for close quarter combat, the Squire handles beautifully. It is a very responsive sword that feels \u201calive\u201d and light in the hand. Easily wieldable even in novice hands, the Squire dagger's characteristics make it a medieval weapon of choice for all collectors. The dagger is perfectly balance for swift movement and powerful delivery in both cut and thrust motions.&nbsp;\n\nWhile historically made for the noble elites, the Squire is perfect for beginner and advanced students of the sword. The Crusader dagger is a light, responsive and enjoyable dagger to handle while being resilient enough to withstand actual use in combat.\n\n<strong>Specs</strong>\n5160 High Carbon Steel\nDual hardened&nbsp;tempered to a Rockwell of 53\nTotal length: 17\u2033\nBlade length: 12\u2033\nHandle length: 3 1/4\u2033\nBlade width at base: 1 1/2\u2033\nWeight: &nbsp;1lbs 0oz",

It is light, versatile, beautifully made and most importantly, destructive !&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe Midgard serpent J\u00f6rmungandr is a central component of Norse mythology, so much so that it extends both far into the past and far into our own future. Also known as the Midgard Serpent or the World Serpent, J\u00f6rmungandr was the offspring of the Norse god Loki, and appears in several Norse writings. The Prose Edda is the primary source for our knowledge about J\u00f6rmungandr, though many surviving skaldic poems make reference to this being especially as gods such as Thor encounter it in their adventures. Like Fenrir the wolf, Yggdrasil the world tree, and the gods themselves, J\u00f6rmungandr is one of the central features of Viking lore and is one of the beings that will begin the final battle of Ragnar\u00f6k.\n\nJ\u00f6rmungandr\u2019s origins in Norse mythology are similar to the other children of Loki. Many ages ago, the importance of Loki's three children - J\u00f6rmungandr, Fenrir, and the goddess Hel - was foretold. Odin, seeking to delay Ragnar\u00f6k as long as possible, banished these three children from Asgard. J\u00f6rmungandr he cast deep into the ocean, where the great serpent would grow so massive that he would wrap around the entire planet in a huge circle. In most depictions of J\u00f6rmungandr, he is depicted in this pose encircling the world and biting the end of his tail like an Ouroboros, an ancient symbol found in many cultures from the early world. According to prophecy about the end of the world, when J\u00f6rmungandr releases the end of his tail from his jaws the final battle of the gods will begin. J\u00f6rmungandr and Thor are fated to fight each other to the death, and while Thor will kill the World Serpent it's poison will corrupt the God of Thunder utterly - he will make it but nine paces away from his foe before falling. Certainly, not an end you will see in Marvel movies.\n\nThe name J\u00f6rmungandr is an almost poetic title that likely means \u201cThe Vast Binding,\u201d and similar to his brother Fenrir J\u00f6rmungandr spends the majority of world history bound but fated to be released one day. This is a recurring theme in Norse mythology, that great evils are prevented from harming our world but only for a short time. Ragnar\u00f6k, and the end of all things, are inevitable. The only thing that prevents this is the actions the gods have taken to hold back the dark and protect us from the final battle for as long as they can.\n\nThe Birger axe is inspired by the protection of the gods. A Peterson Type B/Wheeler III design, the axe head shape was commonly used between the 600-840\u2019s CE. The upper edge of the head has a relatively gentle curve, while the bottom edge steeply drops into a deep beard. This creates a long cutting and splitting blade capable of severe destruction. The hardwood handle is extended to allow for improved reach, making this not just a raiding weapon but a weapon of war. The Norse knotwork depicts a rising serpent, indicative of J\u00f6rmungandr and the threat he poses to our world. An intimidating presence, the Birger axe is our offering to those who are protectors in their own realms.\n\nTotal Length : 35\u201d\nViking Axe head (width): 8\u201d\nViking Axe head (Hight) 7\u201d long\nWeight: 4 lbs. 1 oz.",

It is light, versatile, beautifully made and most importantly, destructive !&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn Scandinavian, Birger means to \u201chelp and protect\u201d \u2013 a name fitting for a beastly Norse axe. Inspired by the Midgard Serpent from Norse Mythology who is depicted in Norse knotwork on the head, the Birger Norse Viking axe is based on designs by the migration period of the Nordic people. The design of the head gives the axe a steep beard and long cutting edge, while keeping a solid neck and sharp spurs to reinforce and strengthen it for battle. Nearly 4 ft from end to end, the hardwood handle is extended to provide extra reach and torque for powerful, helmet (and head) splitting blows. Axes like this are one reason why an encounter with Viking raiders in the ancient world was so feared, and why their legends are still spread today.\n\nTotal Length : 35\u201d\nViking Axe head (width): 8\u201d\nViking Axe head (Hight) 7\u201d long\nWeight: 4 lbs. 1 oz.",

They were made in Gondolin for the Goblin-wars. They must have come from a dragon\u2019s hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. \u2026 This, Gandalf, was Glamdring, Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore. Keep them well!\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\"><em>\u2013The Hobbit, Chapter 3</em></span></p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">In Tolkien's Silmarillion, the fall of Gondolin is a tragic tale of epic proportions. One of the reasons for the depths of the story\u2019s tragedy is certainly because of the height from which the city fell - Gondolin was the greatest city the elves ever built, and yet it came to ruin because of deception and treachery. If Gondolin had not been a city of such great beauty and power it's destruction would not have been felt so keenly. Only the Battle of Sudden Flame may have been a greater defeat for the elves in all of Tolkien's writings, and yet from the destruction of Gondolin came the seeds of hope for Middle Earth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">During the wars against the Dark Lord Morgoth, the Valar Ulmo (long a supporter of the elves in Middle Earth) chose to provide for them a bastion of light against the darkness. He showed Turgon, one of the Noldor and son of Fingolfin, a hidden valley in the mountains that would be nearly impossible for the enemy to find. Turgon spent 75 years with his people building the city of Gondolin, and when it was completed led a great number of the Noldor and Sindar to live in it. This was to be the last great hope of the elves, and in order to maintain secrecy none were allowed to leave without permission. Gondolin was a bright city of marble and stone, and many great elves lived there and practiced their arts. This included the creation of many weapons that were imbued with magic to make them more effective against the servants of Morgoth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">Unfortunately, Turgon\u2019s faith in the secrecy of his city led to downfall. 400 years after it was founded, Turgon was warned by a messenger from Ulmo that the city would be destroyed - but the great elf king trusted in the hidden valley too well. Like in many tales the downfall of this city came form within; Turgon\u2019s nephew Maeglin, though a smith and warrior in service of Gondolin of great renown, had a dark desire in his heart. He wished to marry his cousin Idril, Turgon's daughter, something he was never permitted to do. When Idril later wed the mortal man Tuor, Maeglin became bitter and resentful, and when given the opportunity he betrayed the city to Morgoth in exchange for a promise that Idril would be given to him when the city fell. Gondolin was razed to the ground by Morgoth\u2019s armies, and Maeglin was killed by Tuor in the assault. Despite this tragedy the child of Tuor and Idril would go on to lead Middle Earth to victory against the forces of Morgoth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 115%;\">The Sage Dagger is our short version of the Sage Sword, based on Glamdring the weapon of Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings films. Glamdring, also called the Foe Hammer, is a sword made by the elves of Gondolin many thousands of years before the Lord of the Rings takes place. After the destruction of Gondolin it went missing, until it was found by accident in a troll cave by Bilbo Baggins and his Dwarven companions during the events of The Hobbit. Our dagger version of the Sage is intended to be a companion to the two-handed sword version. This is a short (12\" blade), leaf-blade dagger with a wide base, narrow neck, and flared tip. The ricasso of the dagger has swooping curves leading into the sharply defined fuller. The guard and pommel are miniature versions of the Sage Two Handed Sword, making it stand out as an obvious companion piece. As many of the great weapons of Gondolin were made by the hand of Maeglin before he turned to the dark, it is possible that Glamdring itself was made by him - in which case, this too could be one of his make. A responsive and graceful weapon, the Sage Dagger is perfect as a standalone weapon or as a companion to its larger version.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/uIGjrzukhX8\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<strong>Specs</strong>\n5160 High Carbon Steel\nDual hardened&nbsp;tempered to a Rockwell of 53\nTotal length: 18.5\u2033\nBlade length: 12\u2033\nHandle length: 3 1/4\u2033\nBlade width at base: 1 1/2\u2033\nWeight: &nbsp;1lbs 5oz",

We are currently taking&nbsp;<strong>pre-production orders.</strong>&nbsp;The first batch will be&nbsp;<strong>completed in January 2024.</strong>&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">Inspired by Glamdring, the sword of Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings films, The Sage Dagger is a companion weapon to one of the more famous fantasy swords in recent times. This leaf bladed dagger is a light and powerful piece that is more than just a smaller version of a larger sword \u2013 it is a true weapon in its own right, with 12 in of blade and 1 lb 5 oz of weight behind it.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">Despite being a fantasy dagger, the Sage has been designed and crafted for actual use and combat. The dagger handles beautifully. It is a very responsive sword that feels \u201calive\u201d , light yet powerful. The relatively wide leaf shaped blade feels like it can deliver damaging blows to anything in it's path, while keeping a look of grace. The Sage dagger's characteristics make it a fantasy weapon of choice for collectors and will certainly be a centerpiece and a conversation piece at the center of any collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\"><strong>Specs</strong></span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">5160 High Carbon Steel</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Dual hardened&nbsp;tempered to a Rockwell of 53</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Total length: 18.5\u2033</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade length: 12\u2033</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Handle length: 3 1/4\u2033</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade width at base: 1 1/2\u2033</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Weight: &nbsp;1lbs 5oz</span>",

    "content": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">War was more than just a part of life for most of the Middle Ages; it was practically a political institution. Borders were moved or erased, kingdoms rose and fell, and entire people groups could be wiped out, incorporated into larger groups, or suddenly find themselves at the top of a political food chain they never realized they were climbing. This was the case across most of the world, no less so the Middle East than anywhere else. As Christian kingdoms warred against each other and against their Muslim neighbors, Muslim kingdoms warred against each other and their Christian neighbors. It could be a little difficult to keep track of who you are supposed to be fighting, never mind why.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">The wars between Cyprus and Mamluk Egypt is one of those conflicts that had the confusing, stop and start patterns which made international wars so difficult to unpack. The 14th century saw a number of recurring conflicts between and among the nations of the Middle East, but it was the beginning of the 15th century when Cyprus and the Mamluk Egyptian belligerence truly began to take off. Early battles were defined by the Cyprus tendency to support piracy against Egyptian and Syrian coastlines, beginning with encouragement and later moving to full financial support. The Mamluk Dynasty would respond in kind, retaliating with various expeditions into Cyprus territory.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">\u202fIn 1414, a temporary truce and peace treaty was signed between the kingdom of Cyprus and Mamluk Egypt. It is possible that this peace treaty was intended to be the start of a long and fruitful partnership between the two nations. As a part of this peace treaty, the Cyprian King Janus made a gift to the Sultan of Egypt of many rich items, such as a number of swords which included the famous Harriet Dean sword that our smiths reproduced (https://www.darksword-armory.com/medieval-weapon/medieval-swords/alexandria-sword-1525/). Most of the fame surrounding the Alexandria Arsenal is regarding the matched pair of Alexandria swords, one of which went missing for decades while the other remained in collections. This is where most of the knowledge for sword collectors starts and finishes when it comes to the Alexandria sword and the surrounding political climate.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Whatever the intentions were for peace between the two nations, the treaty in 1414 had nominal success at best, and only for a short period of time. The pirates funded by the kingdom of Cyprus continued to raid and the Mamluk retaliations increased after 1424, resulting in a full-scale invasion in 1426 and the capture of King Januce who had originally gifted those swords. Cyprus became a tributary of Mamluk Egypt, which lasted until the Ottomans conquered the Mamluk sultanate in 1517. In the long run, though, the kingdom of Cyprus remained a critical trade exchange port and source of many rich exports to the rest of Europe. Cyprus becoming a tributary of Egypt merely opened new markets to its merchants; in the end, between sales of exports and partnership with places like the Venetian government the merchants and royals of Cyprus made out like bandits - even more so than when they were activity doing banditry against Egypt and her allies. It is possible that the gifts of exquisite swords and other riches from Cyprus to the sultanate of Egypt was a ploy to gather more time to prepare additional pirate rates against Egypt's territory - a theory made more likely by the use of Cyprus\u2019 royal vessels accompanying those pirates raids.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">The swords gifted by King Januce to the sultanate of Egypt were Exquisite in quality and true weapons of war as much as they were works of art, and this dagger is no exception. While the Alexandria sword itself is a two-headed weapon, this dagger is obviously intended for use with one hand and would make a fine off hand weapon if used with a single-handed sword. The overall small package of the dagger - 17 inches in length with an 11-inch blade, and a mere 1 lb in weight- belies its deadly potential. The diamond cross section of the blade lends strength for cut and thrust combat, with both edges able to be sharpened right to the hilt. The guard itself retains the swept tips of its parent weapon, a simple and elegant work in plain steel. The wheel pommel at the end of the oxblood leather wrapped handle completes the package, providing counterweight for the blade or a potential for knocking on opponent on the back of the head if need be. Daggers like this evolved into the main gauche, or companion dagger, used in dueling and rapier fighting in later centuries. With the point of balance right at the guard, this is a quick and lively weapon with incredible versatility. Whether it stays on your shelf, joins the Alexandria sword on the wall, or becomes part of your kit as a sidearm the Alexandria dagger is a classic that we hope you will enjoy.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel\nTotal Length: 17\u201d\nBlade Length: 11\u201d\nWeight: 1 lb.\nPOB: at the guard.",

The short (11\"), double-edged blade has a diamond cross section, making it a stiff and unyielding weapon designed to be terribly effective at thrusting. The straight steel guard is a small version of the Alexandria swords guard with the distinctive swept tips that could catch the blade of an opponent. The classic wheel pommel is a twin to the one on the dagger's larger cousin. The Oxblood leather handle and sheath are eye-catching in their quality, marking this as the daily carry of a wealthy individual. Alone or with the Alexandria sword, this dagger is an excellent piece to be proud of in your collection.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Total Length: 17\u201d</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Blade Length: 11\u201d</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Weight: 1 lb.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">POB: at the guard.</span>",

What this means may be unclear to some readers, or even to some watching the films, as Isildur appears only briefly. However, Isildur was more than just the eldest son of Allendale and a brief king of Gondor - in fact, he was of the bloodline of N\u00famenor, that ancient island kingdom filled with magic, intrigue, and for many years the faithful mortals who chose to follow the dictates of the Valar and remain friends with the elves. Unfortunately, this was not to last.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">Living centuries longer than most mortals, the kings of N\u00famenor became more and more haughty and prideful as time went on. They preferred the company of the elves less and less, and considered themselves to be not just lords of their island but over other men form other kingdoms as well. Though their pride grew great they still answered the calls when needed, and even captured the Dark Lord Sauron and brought him back as a prisoner for a time. This proved to be more hubris on their part, as Sauron was able to convince them he was cowed by their power and flattered them greatly. As they listened to the Dark Lord \u2013 who in those days was able to appear fair and beautiful \u2013 more and more, the Kings of N\u00famenor became vulnerable to his influence. Though they had long lives they were fearful of death, and Sauron was able to use this fear to corrupt them utterly. Except for a remnant under the command of a man named Elendil, the island and everyone on it were destroyed.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">Elendil and his family, along with those who remained faithful to the Valar, escaped the destruction of N\u00famenor and founded the Midde Earth kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. When the armies of the survivors of N\u00famenor joined with the elves in the Last Alliance to march against Sauron\u2019s forces in Mordor, Elendil took with him the sword Narsil - not a human weapon, nor an Elvish one; Narsil (along with many other famous weapons) was forged by the dwarf Smith Telchar of Nogrod in the First Age of the world. For those keeping score at home this makes Narsil one of the oldest weapons in the world! When Elendil fell and Narsil broke, Isildur took up with the broken sword of his father and cut the ring from Sauron's hand. By the death of his father and by the raising up of the shards of Narsil Isildur became the new king of Gondor.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">Isildur\u2019s reign would be short-lived, however, as he did not only take the shards of Narsil from the fields of battle but the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Deeply affected by the dark magic of the Ring Isildur kept it close while it slowly corrupted him. He would die a few years later and lose the Ring, which would remain lost for two and a half thousand years. During that time the Kingdom of Gondor was never again ruled by the house of Elendil - not until Aragorn, a direct descendant to Isildur, would take up the shards of Narsil reforged into Anduril, Flame of the West, and seek to claim the throne that was his birthright.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">Our Anduril Dagger, companion to our ever-popular Anduril Sword, is somewhat of a hybrid between a dagger and a short sword. With a blade length of 21\u201d and a total length of 29.5\u2033, it certainly carries with it more presence than the average dagger. The guard and pommel bear the White Tree of Gonder, symbol of the house of the king and identical to the Anduril sword (if smaller in size). The blade is an exact scale replica of the full sized sword blade, complete with intricate elven runes and a single fuller. For full size fans of Lord of the Rings, this is a fine companion piece to our primary version of the Anduril. For fans of smaller or slighter stature, this might make a more interesting piece as a small sword for riding or daily wear \u2013 similar to how Bilbo Baggins in Tolkien\u2019s The Hobbit used a long elven dagger as a sword.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel. Dual Hardened.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">Total length: 29.5\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">Blade length: 21\"</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 110%;\">Weight: 1 lbs. 14 oz.</span>\n\n&nbsp;",

The 21 inch blade is marked with elvish runes exactly the same as the full size Anduril sword, though as the runes are smaller and on a smaller steel canvas they appear even more intricate. The double-edged single fullered blade leads to miniature versions of the Anduril fittings developed by Darksword Armory, including the White Tree of Gondor on the tips of the pommel and guard. The beautifully detailed leather handle completes the piece and sets it apart as a true weapon in its own right. Whether alone or paired with its larger version, the Anduril Dagger is a formidable weapon and exquisite work of art by the talented hands that work our forge.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

    "content": "&nbsp;\n\nHistory was not always written by the victor; for countless generations before literacy was humanity's primary method of passing on our lore, we maintained our history through oral traditions. Songs, epic poems, and stories memorized by rote were our only way to maintain tradition and teach future generations where we had come from. In most cultures, elders would maintain knowledge of the past and pass it on to the future; this task fell to the specially appointed office of the skald.\n\nMuch like bards in Celtic cultures, the Norse skalds were responsible for memorizing and sharing poems, stories, history, literature, and tales of gods and heroes. More than simply memorization and repetition, a skald was expected to entertain and enrich the lives of the listeners, especially during long winters when writing parties were forced to stay at home and many state indoors for days or weeks on end. To do so, they employed certain styles of verse, composition, and complex figurative language motifs known as kennings to stick in their listener's minds and inspire repetition and memorization. This led to skalds becoming highly prized members of Viking courts, attending to the kings of Norway and other Nordic countries by the 9th century.\n\nDuring this time, the role of the skald expanded to include creating poetry and spinning tales of their patrons\u2019 greatness, battle prowess, or other heroic deeds. These could often be heavily exaggerated, even hyperbolic, as the Kings and nobles had a vested interest in being portrayed in a positive light to their subjects. However, this also led to skalds developing fearsome reputations among the lords - multiple examples exist of skulls composing sarcastic, defiant, even embarrassing prose that could negatively impact the reputations even of the very wealthy and powerful. Of course, this became even more of an issue when in the 10th-11th centuries, skalds increasingly began to write down their works for future generations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWritten works of the Nordic skalds are of such quantity and quality that they surely represent the tip of the iceberg for what must have once existed. In addition to Eddic poetry (another form of Nordic verse), skaldic poems survive in more than 700 manuscripts, many of whom have authors known to modern historians. The names of\n\nhundreds of skalds are known over a period of more than four centuries, preserved in their writings and in later lists collected by authors as late as the 13th century. Some of these names include:\n\n&nbsp;\nBragi Boddason, known as Bragi the Old\nEinarr Helgason, known as sk\u00e1laglamm (\"tinkle-scales\")\nGunnlaugr Ormstunga, known as \"Wormtongue\" for his biting sarcasm\nThj\u00f3d\u00f3lf of Hvinir\nAmong many others.\n&nbsp;\nThe surviving collections of poems and tales, detailing the Viking history and the names and deeds of the gods and other mythological figures, have been gathered in specific manuscripts such as the Prose Edda. Due to the advent of Christianity in the Nordic countries, though, the office of the skald slowly transitioned towards Christian stories and mythology, resulting in the dying out of the scholarship traditions sometime between the years 1400 and the 16th century.\n\nInspired by the skalds and the great deeds they spoke of, the Darksword Armory Skald is a minimalist Viking sword design executed with precision and grace. A brown leather handle is bookended by an unadorned, curved crossguard of the type typically seen on early Type X swords on one end; on the other, a classic five-lobed pommel caps the design. Both of these deceptively plain-looking pieces of hilt furniture reveal themselves as works of art to those who can appreciate a simple concept executed well, and are polished to a mirror finish. The handle itself is wrapped without stitching, creating a slip resistant grip without the danger of chafing brought about by a rough seam. Gloves will not be necessary to wield this sword for extended periods.\n\nThe most unique feature of the skald is its blade. The broad base tapers aggressively toward the tip, resulting in a point of balance close enough to the hilt that the sword fairly springs into action when put through its paces. Two features unique to this blade set it aside from the average Viking sword: first, the tip is sharply terminated rather than spatulate; second, two fullers, not one, run the length of the blade. The stiff spine between the fullers lend strength and stability to the blade, promising a resilient weapon that would survive many seasons of campaigning or raiding. The Darksword Armory Skald is a Viking sword worthy of any subject of an epic poem, and we hope that your adventures with it will be worthy of legend and song.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\nSPECS of the Skald Norse sword:\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

    "excerpt": "&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 110%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">In Norse culture, skalds were a special class of storyteller, poet, and historian who carried and passed on their people's mythology. The Darksword Armory Skald is inspired by those keepers of Viking Legend. A long, broad-based blade suitable for the slashing combat style used by Viking raiders terminates in a sharply pointed tip, and is polished to a mirror finish. A 5 lobed pommel design as described by Jakobsson in Krigarideologi och vikingatida sv\u00e4rdstypologi is complimented by a simple cross guard often seen on Type X swords and earlier. Unique Darksword\u2019s design, the skald has a double fuller - rarely seen, if ever, in the historical surviving artifacts. A suitable companion for a warrior poet, the Darksword Armory skald is a crisp and a classic design for fans of Viking weaponry</span></p>\nSPECS:\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-53943\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Warranty-Banner-434x800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"332\">Blade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

The aspect of the film most reviled by Scottish citizens is its portrayal of Robert the Bruce as coward, as someone who betrayed William Wallace, and as a Scottish traitor. In the film, only Wallace convinces Robert the Bruce to finally turn his strength against King Edward II. In reality, Robert the Bruce fought the English independently of Wallace for many years. However, the film ending on the decisive Battle of Bannockburn is at least appropriate, as Bannockburn was the location of one of Robert the Bruce's greatest victories in the Wars for Scottish Independence.\n\nRobert the Bruce, born Robert the first in 1274 CE, was one of many claimants for the Scottish throne in the late 13th century. He and his family participated in campaigns against the English, including some alongside William Wallace. Prior to Wallace's death in 1305, Robert the Bruce and many other Scottish nobles vied for their place in line for the throne. In 1306, Robert killed his rival John Comyn, swiftly seized the crown, and began a cut-and-thrust guerilla campaign against the English throughout Scottish territories.\n\nIn 1310 Robert began a very successful campaign involving several major battles against the English. Edward II of England refuse to back down, though, and in 1314 sent an army of devastating size against Robert the Bruce's much smaller force. The two armies would meet south of the city of Stirling close to the Bannockburn Stream, for a battle that would last two days - almost unheard of in medieval warfare.\n\nEngland sent over 20,000 men including knights and heavy infantry, which would make it the largest army to ever invaded Scotland. The Scottish forces were outnumbered three to one.&nbsp;On the first day of the battle, the English Advanced in order to retake the city of Stirling. The Scottish troops pushed the English across the river. Elsewhere, the heavily armed English - bogged down by their gear in the swampy marshland - suffered greatly and turned back to their camp in discouragement.\n\nIn the early hours of the following morning, Robert the Bruce led his army in an assault against the English position. The English were in complete disarray, with smaller English parties being quickly surrounded and killed and numerous commanders being slain. The English cavalry being pinned against the banks of the river, and English archers inflicting casualties on friendly forces, thousands of English knights and soldiers were killed or captured, and Edward II barely escaped with his life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Battle of Bannockburn was more than a single skirmish - it was a culmination of Robert the Bruce\u2019s path to becoming king of an independent Scotland. This battle represented the Turning of the tide, and established Robert the Bruce not only as King of Scotland but as a hero.&nbsp;\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>SPECS</strong>\nBlade Material: 5160 High Carbon Steel.&nbsp;\nBlade length: 32.5\"\nTotal length: 42.5\"\nBlade width at base: 2\"\nWeight: 3 lbs&nbsp; 3 oz\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; <img class=\" wp-image-53958 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scottish-Sword-Medieval-1317-2-565x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"425\" height=\"602\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

A similar sword is represented on a funeral monument believed to be that of Robert de Greenlaw (died 1411) at Kinkell, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The original resides in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, having been bequeathed to the museum in the late 1970s from a private collection. The single-handed, double-edged sword is a unique take on the standard nightly arming sword designs, with upswept and flared cross guard matched with the classic wheel pommel with a peen block. The sword is named after the Scottish hero, Robert the Bruce, who united the clans during the war of Scottish independence and eventually turned the tide in the battle of Bannockburn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(14, 14, 14)\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div data-ogsc=\"rgb(14, 14, 14)\">SPECS\nBlade Material: 5160 High Carbon Steel\nBlade length: 32.5\"\nTotal length: 42.5\"\nBlade width at base: 2\"\nWeight: 3 lbs&nbsp; 3 oz</div>",

    "content": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 250%;\">The Gudrun Norse Viking Axe</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Saga of the Volsungs, also known as the V\u00f6lsunga saga, is one of our most famous surviving epic works of prose in Old Norse. A 13th century work based on a much older myth and Legend, including the epic poetry of the Elder Edda, the V\u00f6lsunga saga tells the tale of the rise and fall of the V\u00f6lsung clan. This clan includes the descendants of the great hero V\u00f6lsung, the progenitor of many great figures from the Norse tales. Most famous among these was Sigurd, also known as Siegfried, who would be remembered for many things - slaying a dragon, wielding the magic sword Gram, and his ill-fated marriage to Gudrun. Gudrun, called Gu\u00f0r\u00fan or Kriemhild depending on the source and renamed Gutrune in Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle, was a central figure in many Norse works of epic poetry and history. While her story varies from source to source, enough common threads remain to construct a tale of romance and woe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSigurd was a sought-after ally by many kings and husband by many women, though chief among these were Brynhild the shieldmaiden and Gudrun, daughter of the sorceress Grimhild. While both women had their eyes set on the man, it seemed that Sigurd was likely to choose Brynhild for his bride - after all, he had encountered her after his quest to slay Fafnir the dragon, and at first thought her to be a great (male) warrior - until he cut off her armor and discovered the beautiful woman within. However, Gudrun\u2019s mother was determined that her daughter would be Sigurd\u2019s wife. Grimhild gave Sigurd a magic potion which caused him to forget his love for Brynhild, and thus was free to marry Gudrun.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGrimhild\u2019s machinations were not complete, though. She desired also a strong match for her son Gunnar, and convinced Sigurd to help Gunnar to make Brynhild his wife. However, Brynhild had placed herself within a hall surrounded by a magical flame and had vowed to only marry one brave enough to ride through the flames. It was her belief that only Sigurd would have the courage to do so, and in this she was correct - Gunnar, faced with the enchanted wall of fire, refused to pass through it. Using Grimhild\u2019s magic, Sigurd and Gunnar exchange shapes, and Sigurd rode through the flames wearing the appearance of his brother-in-law. Reluctantly, Brynhild married Gunnar and became Sigurd and Gudrun\u2019s sister-in-law.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome years later, Brynhild discovers the deception and is filled with a great fury. She confronts her husband and informs him that she knows she was deceived and tells him she will have revenge upon everyone involved. Attempting to appease his wife, Gunnar tricks Gudrun\u2019s youngest brother Guthormr into attacking Sigurd in his sleep. Sigurd, wakened by his mortal wound, lashed out with his enchanted sword and cut Guthormr in two, and Gudrun awoke to discover both her husband and\n\nher brother dead. Laughing at the other woman\u2019s grief, Brynhild takes her own life. Sigurd\u2019s great wealth of gold and jewels passed to Gudrun\u2019s brothers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGudrun\u2019s story does not end with the death of Sigurd. Apparently not finished with controlling her daughter\u2019s life, Grimhild orders her daughter to marry King Atli, widely understood to be Attila the Hun. While she is unhappy to do so, Gudrun follows her mother's wishes and marries the Hun. Some years later, Gudrun\u2019s brothers come to visit her (the reasons why vary from tale to tale), and the dragon\u2019s wealth they inherited from Sigurd is immediately apparent to King Atli. Claiming he is seeking revenge for the death of the great hero Sigurd, Atli attacks Gudrun\u2019s brothers, and unable to prevent the fight, Gudrun puts on armor and fights alongside her brothers until each of her brothers fall in battle. Unaware of his wife's betrayal, Atli holds a funeral feast for the many champions that Gudrun\u2019s brothers killed. Gudrun takes advantage of the revelry to kill Atli\u2019s sons, feeding their hearts to their own father, and then killing her husband while he sleeps. As Atli lays dying in his hall, Gudrun sets the hall on fire and the Hun\u2019s entire household are burned alive. Depending on the version of the story, Gudrun herself also perishes in the flames or escapes to have other adventures. While many sources exist for her story, the V\u00f6lsunga saga and the Nibelungenlied may be the most complete, and it is from these tales that the inspiration for our newest axes comes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Gudrun Viking Axe is our latest Norse axe design, and exhibits many features common to the two-handed, long handled axes used extensively across the Scandinavian lands. This design features a Type M in the Peterson typology or Type 6 in the wheeler typology head, with steep Spurs, a slender and delineated neck, and a thin blade with upper and lower edges curving sharply. The dating of these ax heads runs from the early 10th century well into the 13th, making it a reasonable approximation of the types of axes that would have been in use during Gudrun\u2019s story. The handle is a stained hardwood, decorated with leather accents, and sloping gracefully towards the end in order to allow for comfortable lower-handed grip to improve maneuverability. The face of the axe head is blackened and decorated with a stylized version of J\u00f6rmungandr the World Serpent, certainly one of the only creatures in Midgard who's bravery and fury can match Gudrun herself. Suitable for use doing Viking things, but beautiful enough to be a centerpiece of any home display or private collection, the Gudrun Norse Viking Axe is our attempt to honor one of the great shieldmaidens of Norse history.\n\nTotal Length : 47\u201d\nViking Axe head (width): 9\u201d\nViking Axe head (hight) 12\u201d long\nWeight: 4 lbs. 12 oz.",
    "excerpt": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 250%;\">The Gudrun Norse Viking Axe</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\nNamed for the shieldmaiden, hero, and architect of one of the most bloody and decisive revenge stories in Norse lore, the Gudrun Norse Viking Axe is our newest axe design. From the pages of the V\u00f6lsunga saga, Gudrun (Gu\u00f0r\u00fan) is a stirring tale of someone pushed too far until the weight of her many burdens causes her to take matters into her own hands and leaves a bloody and fiery swath of destruction behind her as a result. Decorated with a Viking knotwork design depicting the Midgard Serpent, this long-bladed and straight-necked Viking axe is a design both classic and capable. Its hardwood handle provides a stable and comfortable grip, and is long enough to provide the torque needed for powerful blows against Shield, helmet, or enemy. A balance between functionality and work of art, the Gudrun Norse Viking Axe would do any Viking proud - especially shieldmaidens on a path to revenge.\n\nTotal Length : 47\u201d\nViking Axe head (width): 9\u201d\nViking Axe head (hight) 12\u201d long\nWeight: 4 lbs. 12 oz.",

For in those quiet moments between heartbeats, its shadow dances alongside \u2013 a faithful companion that neither speaks nor strays. The shadow moves as the wolf moves, a silent guardian that stands watch when the wolf rests, and stretches long and fierce when the wolf rises to face its foes.</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">The Skuggi is the shadow to the Eindride sword \u2013 shorter in length but no less deadly, quiet but ever-present. Where the Eindride represents the overt strength of the lone wolf, the Skuggi embodies its cunning and stealth. This dagger's aged bronze guard whispers tales of twilight pack, its pattern subtly echoing the larger sword's design but with wolf tracks rather than heads \u2013 a reminder that even when walking alone, we leave our mark upon the world.</span>\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">The grip, wrapped in night-dark leather, leads to an aged bronze pommel. Like a shadow, this blade will never abandon its wielder.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Together with the Eindride, the Skuggi forms a complete tale of survival. For while the sword speaks of facing one's battles head-on, the dagger reminds us that wisdom sometimes lies in stealth and cunning. When the path grows dark and the way uncertain, the Skuggi serves as a reminder that shadows need not be feared \u2013 for they can be our most loyal companions in our darkest hours.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">Let the Skuggi be your silent guardian, your shadow in the night, your faithful companion when the path leads through darkness. For even the lone wolf knows: sometimes the greatest strength lies not in the obvious, but in the subtle.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 120%;\">The Skuggi is hand crafted from 5160 High carbon steel.

They were made in Gondolin for the Goblin-wars. They must have come from a dragon's hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. ... This, Gandalf, was Glamdring, Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore. Keep them well!\"</p>\n<em>--The Hobbit, Chapter 3</em>\n\nElves are mythical and magical creatures in many forms of fantasy literature, and nowhere do they receive more attention than in J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s writings. The firstborn Children of the creator Iluvatar, the Elves\u2019 long history winds through countless triumphs and tragedies written as only Tolkien could write. They awoke under the stars of Middle Earth in a time before the sun and the moon existed, and were beloved of the Valar \u2013 the gods of Middle Earth. Because of their great love for the Elves the Valar gathered a large number of them and brought them to the undying land of Valinor across the sea, keeping them safe from harm.\n\nAlas, the Valar could not keep the Elves safe from their own foolish pride. While in Valinor the mighty craftsman F\u00ebanor forged the holy Silmarils, gems of surpassing beauty, using the light that the Valar had brough into the world. Even though he had not created this light F\u00ebanor was haughty about his work and denied them to any but his own hand. This created a deep divide between F\u00ebanor\u2019s allies and those loyal to the Valar, and into that divide crept Melkor the dark Valar.\n\nMelkor stole the Silmarils and slew F\u00ebanor\u2019s beloved father, then fled to his fortress back in Middle Earth. What followed was centuries of bloody battles as first F\u00ebanor and then his sons and their houses pursued Melkor and sought to strip him of the Silmarils that they believed were theirs by right. As the battles dragged on the sons of F\u00ebanor and their allies began to set up kingdoms of their own to rule, and of these kingdoms none were so beautiful, so powerful, and so glorious and Gondolin.\n\nRuled by Turgon, nephew of F\u00ebanor and High King of the Elves known as the Nolder, Gondolin was a city hidden deep in the mountains and accessible only by concealed paths. The city was\n\nbuilt in secret as the last bastion of safety for the Noldor, to be their seat of power from which to wage war upon the forces of darkness. The stories about Gondolin and its eventual discovery and destruction by the forces of Melkor are far too many to be included here (see The Silmarillion for more details), but what can be told is that from the forges of Gondolin came many mighty weapons of great power \u2013 and of these weapons, perhaps none are as famous as Glamdring the Foe Hammer.\n\nA long sword of great beauty, Glamdrin belonged to the ruler of Gondolin. Turgon wielded Glambring in many battles including the Battle of Unnumbered Tears where the Elves and their allies were routed thanks to the treachery of men. Turgon likely used the sword as well during the fall of Gondolin, after which it became lost for thousands of years and might have passed out of Tolkien\u2019s lore altogether. However, Glamdring actually makes its first appearance for most readers in the pages of The Hobbit, when Gandalf the Grey finds it in a troll-cave along with other Elven blades and treasures. Gandalf carries the sword for the rest of his adventures, and it likely accompanied him when he left Middle Earth and returned to his masters in Valinor.\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\nA deep respect for Tolkien and his works was maintained during the creation of this battle ready sword. The smooth and subtle curves of the blade, guard and pommel were meant as a reflection of wisdom and understanding while the downward looping guard flows towards the curves of the blade in a form of dance between both parts. Despite this seemingly fragile aestheticism, this medieval fantasy sword is nothing but stern. It\u2019s 2\u2033 wide blade delivers destructive cutting blows with a very sharp tip, leading to equally devastating thrusts. The Sage fantasy sword is not only an eye catcher, it is also a definite force on the battle field.\n\nAs with all our battle ready swords, the Sage is hand forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel. The blade has been dual hardened. The Tang of the blade has been hot peened over the pommel.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/uIGjrzukhX8\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTotal length: 49\"\nBlade length: 36\"\nCrossguard: 10\"\nHandle and pommel 10\"\nBlade: 5160 Folded Steel&nbsp;\nFittings: Mild Steel\nWeight : 4lbs 9oz.\nPOB : 4\"",

The Elves fight against the Dark Lord for a millennium, sometimes winning decisive battles, other times bring brought to the brink of extinction. Only their strength that burns in their hearts seems to help them carry the day; their strength and the weapons of power that they create.

Given the multitude of Viking swords on the market, one wonders whether the market is saturated. Many reproductions, however, play into the stereotype of Viking swords as little more than long cleavers \u2013 heavy, brutish weapons wielded by a brutal people. These reproductions fail to capture the spirit or \u201cfunction\u201d of the Viking sword as an important step in the evolution of the European medieval swords, from earlier Romanesque styles to the arming swords of late medieval period.\n\nA descendant of the Roman spatha, a longsword used by Roman officers, the Viking sword is a fascinating piece of history. Even during the Roman Empire steel, and the skill needed to forge long blades that were strong and resilient, was extremely expensive. Cheaper and nearly as effective were axes, Spears, or short-bladed swords such as the Gladius. However, advancements in technology and smithcraft allowed for the development of longer and more robust blades that could be made thinner than was previously possible. This meant less steel was needed to produce a sword, and though they remained expensive the ongoing development put swords in the hands of many a warrior across Europe. Central to this development was the Frankish Empire, specifically during the Carolingian era (9th century CE). The best weapons in Europe during the Viking age were produced in the Frankish Empire, and through trade and as a result of raids made their way into the hands of the Viking Raiders. Eventually, the Norse smiths themselves began to copy the techniques developed during the Frankish Empire, building on previous knowledge to produce their distinctive designs.\n\nThese distinctive designs stand apart from the later Medieval styles that were to follow, and can be uniquely categorized as a result. The most authoritative typology of the Viking swords was written by Dr. Jan Peterson in 1919. Focusing on variations in pommel and guards to formulate a 26 category scheme, Jan Perterson created a typological reference to determine the date of each subtype.\n\nThe five lobed Viking battle ready sword is the quintessential Norse weapon during the Viking age. The blade has the distinctive wide fuller and spatulate tip typical of designs from the Viking era. While using a Type 4 blade from the Geibig Typology, we fitted the five lobe Viking medieval sword with an extended handle that is long enough for both \u201chammer\u201d and \u201chandshake\u201d grip.\n\nThe type 4 blade, found from the mid-tenth century through the mid-eleventh century, features a slight taper and a fuller which extends the blade\u2019s full length. We carefully crafted this Viking medieval sword to reflect the Norse cultural and artistic heritage. Exceptional tools of war, the Viking medieval swords also attest to the Viking culture\u2019s keen interest in art and aesthetic beauty. This Viking battle ready sword features a 30 inch blade, forged with 5160 High Carbon Steel and dual hardened. A simple yet elegant weapon, worthy of warriors and kings.&nbsp;\n\nBlade: 5160 High Carbon Steel.

So he came against Sigurd with a great army, he and his brothers with him, and an exceeding fierce fight befell; many a spear and many an arrow might men see there raised aloft, axes hard driven, shields cleft and byrnies torn, helmets were shivered, skulls split atwain, and many a man felled to the cold earth.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">- The V\u00f6lsunga Saga, CHAPTER XVII. Of Sigurd's Avenging of Sigmund his Father</p>\n&nbsp;\n\nDespite what modern pop culture teaches us about the history of Western Europe, the sword was not the most common weapon of the ancient world - nor was it the most effective. Across many different kingdoms that rose and fell, other weapons were at the forefront of every battle. the spear, the longboat, the polearm - all of these had their place as the most common, most fearsomely efficient close quarters weapon. For the Norse, also called the Vikings, the weapon that won them through raids, battles, wars, and conquest was the axe. And of these accidents, there was perhaps none as famous nor as feared as the long axe.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-68622\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1774-excavated-viking-dane-axe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"386\" height=\"615\">Like other war axes, the Lang\u00f8x is a descendant of those crude, early tools that were a mainstay of every hearth and home. Cutting wood for fire and for homebuilding is a worldwide practice throughout human history, and the ancestors of the Norse are no exception. An axe requ<span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">ired less high-quality metal to make than did a sword, which made it a natural choice when creating early weapons for people to use against their fellow humans. By changing the shape of the woodcutting axe \u2013 slimming the head, lengthening the blade \u2013 it became much more suitable for wielding in battle. Though it lacked the reach of a spear an axe could be devastatingly effective in close quarters while taking up comparatively little space, which for the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">ship-bound Viking raiders who would need to be able to carry all of their gear on their person made it an ideal choice.</span>\n\nWhile the origins of the Viking long axe may be humble, though, what sets it apart is the level to which it was elevated in Norse culture. One indication is the sheer number of axes recovered from Norse graves; while the handles would often break down the heads of bearded axes (Skegg\u00f8x), broad axes (Brei\u00f0\u00f8x), and long axes (Lang\u00f8x) have all been discovered in graves noble and mean. These weapons could be simple or ornate, decorated or plain, and designed for all sorts of combat needs \u2013 shorter hand axes for defense, throwing, or utilitarian use; long axes for the practical application of physics to the problem of war. The long axe has th\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">is science behind it all the way; by lengthening the handle of an axe the force of its blows would be multiplied, and a warrior could deliver powerful blows that would break shield, armor, and the enemy beneath.</span>\n\nThe Darksword Armory Viking Lang\u00f8x is our latest design, inspired by the Dane axe/broadaxe design that was so popular among Viking warriors \u2013 if the archeological evidence is any indication, that is. Unlike some of our other axes which include intricate knotwork and other decorative elements, this axe is a no-nonsense design made with pure function in mind \u2013 its blackened steel head kept free of adornment, easier to clean without ruining the finish of some lordly fellow\u2019s fancy axe. The head is shaped with a slender neck and a wide cutting edge, narrow enough to reduce unnecessary weight but still capable of devastating blows. The long hardwood handle is stout and no-nonsense, bringing the length of the weapon to three-and-a-half feet - creating powerful force at the end of each swing. This is one of the longest axes we\u2019ve ever made, and it is made to reach as far as you need it to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTotal Length : 42\u201d\nViking Axe head (width): 6\u201d\nViking Axe head (Hight) 10\u201d long\nWeight: 3 lbs. 5 oz.",

A 13th century work based on a much older myth and Legend. In these sagas, Viking warriors were masters of the axe, a weapon as vital to their survival as it was to their conquests. Unlike the shorter, handier axes, the Langox, or <em>Long Axe,</em> is fitted on an extended shaft, a crucial design element that allowed for devastating, far-reaching swings in close-quarters battle. This offers superior reach and leverage for powerful, decisive blows.\n\nDrawing inspiration from excavated axe heads, our team has forged the axe while keeping the form and functionality of the <em>Dane</em>&nbsp; or <em>Broadaxe</em> \u2013 weapons renowned for their immense cutting power and extended range. Every curve of the blade, every detail of the haft, reflects a weapons that shaped an era.\n\nTotal Length : 42\u201d\nViking Axe head (width): 6\u201d\nViking Axe head (Hight) 10\u201d long\nWeight: 3 lbs. 5 oz.",

Like so many Victorian reproductions the original has been replicated in exacting detail right down to the rivets and hinges.&nbsp;\n\nThe vambrace and rerebrace both have the attractive ridges of classical Gothic plate, flowing seamlessly into the lines of the armor. The couter is broad and fluted with a raised point at the elbow, providing not only protection but a potentially dangerous weapon in its own right \u2013someone in Gothic plate is never unarmed. Despite its age the armor has only a light patina in some areas, retaining its luster and sheen \u2013 clearly, this piece was well cared for in its life as an antique. An attractive centerpiece for any collection, this Gothic arm armor comes to us from a prestigious collection and is now available for purchase for one fortunate collector.",

    "content": "<strong>Frederick Stibbert (1838\u20131906)</strong>\nFrederick Stibbert was an Anglo-Italian art collector, businessman, and enthusiast of militaria, born in Florence to a wealthy English family with roots in the East India Company.\n\nInheriting a vast fortune, Stibbert dedicated his life and wealth to collecting weapons and armors, transforming his family villa in Florence into a spectacular museum (see last two images in the image gallery). His primary passion was European Swords and Armors, a subject he studied extensively. He personally traveled throughout Europe to acquire pieces and designed elaborate, creating immersive historical narratives rather than simple static displays.\n\n<strong>The Stibbert Museum, Florence</strong>\nThe Museo Stibbert is one of Florence's most charming and unusual house-museums, the enduring legacy of Frederick Stibbert.\n\nUpon his death in 1906, Stibbert bequeathed his entire collection to the city of Florence. Today, the museum houses over 50,000 artifacts from Europe, the Middle Est and Far East. The armory includes 16,000 pieces of European, Islamic, and Japanese weapons and armor.&nbsp;\n\nThe museum is famed for its theatrical arrangements, most notably the Sala della Cavalcata, a grand hall featuring a simulated parade of fully armored knights on horseback and foot. Stibbert's personal parade armor, now offered for sale, stands as a symbol of the collector's obsession with military history and spectacle.\n\nThis armor offers an unbroken chain of ownership and undeniable authenticity, making it an extraordinary acquisition for any serious collector or institution.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Frederick Stibbert\u2019s Personal Use: The armor was acquired from an antique dealer in Florence, Italy, and is documented as the personal parade armor of Frederick Stibbert.</li>\n \t<li>Museum Seal: Crucially, the inner chest and select parts are stamped with the Stibbert Museum seal, confirming its direct association with the founder and his collection.</li>\n \t<li>Historical Documentation: The gallery includes a historical image of Frederick Stibbert wearing this very armor, providing irrefutable visual proof of its provenance.</li>\n \t<li>Modern Ownership: This piece comes from the private collection of Eyal Azerad, founder of Darksword Armory, who has decided to offer it for sale to make room for new acquisitions.</li>\n</ul>\nPrice: 22,000 USD&nbsp;\n\ncontact us for purchase inquiries or details.&nbsp;",

Formed at the end of the <a href=\"https://www.umich.edu/~eng415/timeline/summaries/First_Crusade.htm\">First Crusade</a> as a group of knights \u2013 originally French \u2013 who took monastic vows, they swore to protect pilgrims travelling from Europe to the Holy Land. Their headquarters was in Jerusalem on the Temple Mount, which led to their name (which references the Temple of Solomon). While the Order began without wealth, living off donations from villagers, the <a href=\"http://www.theknightstemplar.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/knights-templar.jpg\">Templar Knights</a> emerged as an extremely wealthy and politically powerful organisation. One of the reasons for this was Pope Innocent II\u2019s 1139 proclamation that exempted the Order from local laws, which left them answerable to no government except the Pope himself. This catapulted them from an order of militaristic monks into a political force to be reckoned with.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Initially, the Knights Templar were a military order \u2013 and a wildly successful one, with stores of their mounted knights breaking much superior forces. However, as the Order expanded, they began branching out in new and innovative directions. The Order became an early form of bank, able to receive deposits, hold valuables and funds, and provide loans \u2013 with interest, previously forbidden to church organisations. This newfound ability became the Order\u2019s primary focus, and their activities changed to match. Many wealthy and powerful people found themselves in debt to a military order that was above the law in every sense of the word. One such individual was King Phillip IV of France, who was deeply indebted to the Order. King Phillip initiated the fall of the Order in 1307, arresting many Knights Templar and torturing them into admitted to heresy. Facing political pressure as a result of the scandal, Pope Clement ordered the Order dissolved in 1312. Many of their members were executed, their assets were seized and distributed to other orders of the Church, and the last Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, was burned at the stake in 1314. The greatest military force of the Crusader era was gone.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">Despite this fall from grace, the Knights Templar have captured the imagination of modern sword collectors and history enthusiasts. Their weapons have been the subject of much interest, and while many of the original weapons were destroyed and or thrown into rivers following the dissolution of the Order, a handful of good examples survived. Numerous photographs of the original Two Handed Templar sword are published in \u201cThe Journal of Arms and Armour Society\u201d, (Oakeshott, E. \u201cA war sword of the XIVth Century in the Guildhall Museum\u201d). The sword of the crusaders and the Templar Knights, in their crucifix form, exemplifies the archetypical Sword of the middle ages.</span>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 15px;\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lyy33o_PCo8?showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1\" width=\"313\" height=\"176\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 14pt;\">The embellishing of the pommel, with its decorative cross, was common on Templar swords. As a medieval weapon, the Two handed Templar sword is an imposing, powerful yet elegant piece. Hefty, yet carefully balanced for optimum functionality, the sword is resilient, reliable and virtually indestructible. meticulously crafted with a 2.3'' wide blade,&nbsp;&nbsp;the Templar sword not only provides devastating cuts but can thrust through armor with unrivalled ease. &nbsp;In a nutshell, the Two handed Templar sword is a dependable sword that will last for generations.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photograph of the original sword, on display at the Museum of London, in England.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-22106 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1339-Two-Handed-templar-Sword.jpg\" alt=\"Antique-Museum-templar-sword\" width=\"711\" height=\"178\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

Tolkien was writing The Silmarillion, he had several goals. One of them was to write an alternative, fantasy-laden history of Europe (in general) and Britain (in specific). Another was to bring to life many of the rich stories that grew in his own mind as he was immersing himself in ancient Anglo-Saxon texts. But most of all he wrote the book, and all his books, to provide a context for the Elven languages he invented. And in order to do that, he had to write an extensive history full of great characters, great deeds, and fell dangers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-48927\" src=\"https://www.darksword-armory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ringil.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"1083\">Among earliest of these stories are the tales of the first Elves, who awoke in Middle Earth when only stars lit the world. In the days before the Sun and the Moon Middle Earth was watched over by the Valar, gods of Middle Earth who served the Creator Iluvatar. The Valar assisted in the creation of the world and waited for the Children of Iluvatar (Humans and Elves) to awaken. However, they were not alone - also in Middle Earth was Morgoth, a dark Valar who wished not to serve but to rule. The Valar lived far to the West on the great Ilse of Valinor, whereas Morgoth was in hiding in Middle Earth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">When the first Elves awoke they called themselves the Quendi \u2013 meaning the Speakers, as they were the only beings they knew of who spoke. When the Valar, gods of Middle-Earth, realized that the Elves had come into being they knew that they would be vulnerable to danger. Indeed, when Morgoth realized the Elves had awoken he set out to capture as many of them as he could, using his dark magics to twist them into becoming Orcs. The Valar responded by sending an envoy to invite the Elves to come and dwell with them in Valinor. Many Elves joined them on the long journey to Valinor including Finw\u00eb, who would become Lord and King of the group of Elves known as the Noldor. Finw\u00eb was father to a number of powerful elves including F\u00ebanor, creator of the Silmarils. When Finw\u00eb was killed by Morgoth F\u00ebanor and his brothers Fingolfin, Finarfin, and Findis swore revenge and followed Morgoth back to Middle Earth. Of these brothers Fingolfin was the greatest in terms of strength of arms and valour, and after F\u00ebanor\u2019s death Fingolfin would become High King of the Noldor. Fingolfin would lead the Nolder to lay siege to Morgoth\u2019s fortress of Angband for over four centuries, as well as expand the power and control of the Elves in Middle Earth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">If the siege had held Middle Earth may have had lasting peace, but during the intervening four hundred years Morgoth was not idle. In a day known as the Dagor Bragollach or Battle of the Sudden Flame, Morgoth sent forth the full force of his strength \u2013 Balrogs, dragons, and uncountable numbers of Orcs</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">poured out, while mountains cracked and spewed forth vast rivers of magma. Whole kingdoms were wiped off the face of the earth, and while Fingolfin\u2019s fortress survived the might of the Noldor had been brought to ruin. The loss of his people was too much for him to bear, and the greatest warrior of all the Elves went to war.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Now news came to Hithlum that Dorthonion was lost and the sons of Finarfin</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">overthrown, and that the sons of Feanor were driven from their lands. Then</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Fingolfin beheld (as it seemed to him) the utter ruin of the Noldor, and the defeat</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">beyond redress of all their houses; and filled with wrath and despair he mounted</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">upon Rochallor his great horse and rode forth alone, and none might restrain</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">him. He passed over Dor-nu-Fauglith like a wind amid the dust, and all that</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">beheld his onset fled... Thus he came alone to Angband\u2019s gates, and he sounded his horn, and</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">smote once more upon the brazen doors, and challenged Morgoth to come forth</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">to single combat. And Morgoth came.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">&nbsp;</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">That was the last time in those wars that he passed the doors of his stronghold,</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">and it is said that he took not the challenge willingly; for though his might was</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">greatest of all things in this world, alone of the Valar he knew fear. But he could</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">not now deny the challenge before the face of his captains; for the rocks rang</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">with the shrill music of Fingolfin\u2019s horn, and his voice came keen and clear</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">down into the depths of Angband; and Fingolfin named Morgoth craven, and</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">lord of slaves. Therefore Morgoth came, climbing slowly from his subterranean</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">throne, and the rumour of his feet was like thunder underground. And he issued</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">forth clad in black armour; and he stood before the King like a tower, iron-</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">crowned, and his vast shield, sable unblazoned, cast a shadow over him like a</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">stormcloud. But Fingolfin gleamed beneath it as a star; for his mail was overlaid</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">with silver, and his blue shield was set with crystals; and he drew his sword</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Ringil, that glittered like ice.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%;\">&nbsp;</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">From The Silmarillion, Chapter 18 - OF THE RUIN OF BELERIAND AND THE FALL OF FINGOLFIN</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The battle of Fingolfin and Morgoth is one of the greatest scenes in the Silmarillion, and perhaps all fantasy fiction. The fury and the despair, the triumph and the tragedy mingle together to create a perfect moment; we feel Fingolfin\u2019s rage and anguish, and Tolkien\u2019s beautiful prose as he describes the fight is not just text \u2013 it\u2019s art. We can see clearly in our minds eye the terrifying sight of Morgoth towering over the High King, who shines bright in the darkness with a mighty sword in his hand.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">The Darksword Armory Ringil is an Elven sword of great renown. The long, single-edged blade is similar to Swiss designs of the 16th century with a stiff back and a curved tip, though our Elven sword had an exotic flared tip. The curving steel guard includes a finger guard, allowing the wielder to safely wrap a finger to improve their grip. The hardwood grip has been carved with Celtic knotwork reminiscent of the flowing designs of the Elves, which \u2013 when paired with the teardrop pommel \u2013 provides a striking contrast to the bright steel of the rest of the weapon. It is not hard to imagine this sword glittering like ice in the darkness.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 95%; font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Hand-and-a-half or bastard sabres are known for their agile handling, and the Ringil is no exception. This sword has significant blade presence, and certainly feels like it could deal a mortal wound to a Dark Lord. Despite this, the long handle and solid pommel bring the point of balance down to a manageable range, allowing this sword to flow effortlessly through drills or in heated motion. The blade has no fuller, which allowed us to include an Elven inscription in the Tengwar script: \u201cThe slightest crack will permeate light even in the darkest corners of the realm.\u201d This hopeful message exemplifies the mission and the burning purpose of Fingolfin and the mighty Noldor kingdoms.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIGjrzukhX8\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5kLR2-_hQuc\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe style=\"float: right;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dnfaZDFtMA\" width=\"525\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;\ufeff&lt;/span&gt;</iframe>",

There are scratches on the blade and the Ebony wood grip was unevenly centered with the pommel (see image gallery for details). We will polish the sword prior to shipping to remove most of the scratches and blemishes. The sword is in good condition overall. The aesthetic flaws do not affect the sword's structural integrity.&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 100%;\">Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Silmarillion, the Darksword Armory Ringil is a European-style sabre with a fantasy twist. In the ancient history of Middle Earth, Ringil was carried by the elven High King Fingolfin, the most valiant warrior who ever lived. One of the few named weapons in Tolkien\u2019s works, Ringil was used by Fingolfin in his epic single combat against the Dark Lord Morgoth. This deadly Elven blade gave the Dark Lord wounds from which he never recovered. Our version of Ringil is single-edged, as were many of the Elven weapons of the Second Age depicted in the Peter Jackson Fellowship of the Ring prologue. A hand-and-a-half sabre, this sword is similar to 16th century Swiss designs \u2013 with a fantasy twist. With excellent handing, a carved hardwood handle, and Elven script on the blade this sword sits comfortable at the intersection of deadly and beauty.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif; font-size: 80%;\">SPECS:</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Total Length : 46\u201d</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Length: 34\u201d\ngrip: 8.5\"\nBlade Width: 2 \u201d\nCrossguard Length: 6\u201d\nGuard Depth: 7/8\u201d\nWeight: 3 lbs 13oz.&nbsp;\n</span></p>",

As with all our swords, we will polish the entire sword prior to shipping.&nbsp;\n\nSPECS:\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Total Length : 51\u201d</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Length: 38.5\u201d&nbsp;\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">grip: 9\"\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Blade Width: 2 1/16\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Crossguard Length: 9\u201d\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Guard Depth: 7/8\u201d</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">Weight: 3 lbs 5oz.&nbsp;\n</span><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\">P.O.B.: 5 \u00be\u201d</span>",
