This plugin enables HPP and XML payments for Nuvei Gateway using WooCommerce store.

If HPP payment selected, a checkout button on your site will redirect your client to a secure payment page, where the
cardholder enters credit card details. Once the payment is completed, the cardholder is redirected back to your site.
On XML payment, a credit card form will appear, and the gathered data will be sent to Nuvei servers that will
process it and return the payment details.

ApplePay can be used as a payment method during checkout process.

Please make sure the Secure Card storage is enabled on your terminal before enabling payment methods storage in plugin settings.
Please make sure the both Secure Card storage and the Subscriptions features are enabled on your terminal before adding products of Subscription type to your site.
